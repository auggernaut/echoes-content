# STORY GUIDE: The Crimson Moon (Short Version)

---

## 🎬 Intro Hook

Blood Manor is an ancient, living castle perched atop a cliff beneath a crimson moon. Its walls pulse with alien blood magic, and its halls are filled with shifting shadows and the echoes of centuries-old secrets. Tonight, the manor hosts a grand masquerade attended by the Blood King’s vampiric court, rival nobles, and monstrous guests from distant lands. Somewhere within, the legendary vampire hunter Seleana Suantis is held captive, while the Blood King himself plots to secure his immortality and crush any who would oppose him.

## 🎭 Possible Motivations for PCs (with Whys)
- **Rescue Seleana Suantis:** She once saved your life, mentored you, or is a loved one. You owe her a debt—or can’t bear to leave her to the King’s cruelty.
- **Steal the Blood King’s heart:** You crave the power it holds, need it to cure a loved one’s curse, or want revenge for a past wrong.
- **Destroy the Blood King:** He is responsible for the death or suffering of someone you care about, or his reign threatens your homeland or family.
- **Escape the manor alive:** You were lured here under false pretenses, captured while investigating, or simply want to survive and warn the outside world.
- **Uncover the manor’s ancient secrets:** You seek forbidden knowledge to save someone, break a curse, or gain leverage over a rival.

## 🕯️ Secrets & NPC Motivations
- **Blood King:** Seeks to complete a ritual to become unkillable. Paranoid, cruel, but fears his own heart’s destruction.
- **Seleana Suantis:** Imprisoned, but has mapped the castle and set traps. Will help if freed, but insists on rescuing other prisoners.
- **Lord Blackwood (Blood Thrall):** Once a noble, now a thrall at the gate. Seeing his old bat-shaped pin may trigger memories and help break his trance.
- **Lenice (Banshee Noble):** The King’s mother, bound by grief. Can be soothed with memories of her past life; may turn against her son if convinced.
- **Vampire Guests:** Each has their own agenda—some loyal, some seeking to betray the King, some just want to survive.
- **The Castle:** Alive, hungry, and will react to violence or magic. Secret passages and living walls can be manipulated with holy water or blood.
