🎴 Technician Deck (10 Cards)

⸻

Emergency Override
Defense
Prepared, Cunning

“I built the back doors into every system — I can slip through them myself.”

When a system or hazard would cause you a Strike (fire, gas, decompression), roll a d6. On 4+, you bypass or reroute it just in time.

Prompts:
	•	What system did I once save by seconds?
	•	Who hates me for always cutting corners?

⸻

Dive for Cover
Defense
Quick, Desperate

“If sparks fly, I’m already under the table.”

When targeted by an attack, roll a d6. On 5+, you avoid the Strike by ducking into cover.
If you expose another PC while dodging, gain +1 Karma.

Prompts:
	•	Who do I always leave behind when I scramble?
	•	What scar proves I wasn’t fast enough once?

⸻

Failsafe Trigger
Defense
Paranoid, Precise

“If it breaks, I already planned how it’ll break.”

Once per fight, negate a Strike against you by declaring a failsafe you prepared. Describe how it works.

Prompts:
	•	What improvised trick has saved me more than once?
	•	What piece of tech is held together only by luck and prayer?

⸻

Bypass
Ability
Clever, Quick

Once per scene, you may unlock, disable, or reroute one system (doors, alarms, locks) without rolling.

“Every system has a back door. I just need to find it.”
	•	What tool do I always use, no matter how inappropriate?
	•	Who taught me my first hack?

⸻

Systems Savant
Boon
Analytical, Precise

“Every circuit has a rhythm. I just listen for it.”

When repairing, hacking, or bypassing tech, roll +1d6 and keep the highest.

Prompts:
	•	What system have I practically memorized?
	•	Who mistrusts my skill, no matter how often I prove them wrong?

⸻

Mechanical Instincts
Boon
Intuitive, Resourceful

“I don’t fix machines. I understand them.”

When improvising with tools, machines, or jury‑rigged gear, roll +1d6 and keep the highest.

Prompts:
	•	What tool do I always carry, even when it makes no sense?
	•	What machine feels more like family than people do?

⸻

Data Whisperer
Boon
Focused, Eerie

Prompts:
	•	What strange phrase always appears in the data I read?
	•	Who’s afraid of how easily I slip into the system?

⸻

Stabilize Reactor
Ability
Risky, Vital

Once per session, roll a d6. On a 4+, you stabilize a failing system (reactor, engine, life support). On a 1, it worsens dramatically.

“I can keep it together — until I can’t.”
	•	What scar reminds me of the last time I failed?
	•	Who do I work harder for when things go wrong?

⸻

Hot‑Wire
Ability
Improvised, Bold

Once per fight, you may jury‑rig a device or weapon to function in an unintended way. Gain advantage on that roll, then the device breaks.

“Don’t worry, I’ve done this before.”
	•	What’s the stupidest thing I’ve ever hot‑wired?
	•	Who never trusts me with their gear?

⸻

Failsafe Override
Ability
Cautious, Dangerous

Once per session, you can force a system to keep running one more time before total failure.

“Push it past the red, and pray.”
	•	What system did I keep alive longer than it should have lasted?
	•	What part of me still aches from that day?

⸻

Corporate Training
Background
Efficient, Jaded

Once per session, declare you know the specifications of this ship or device. The GM must reveal a useful fact.

“I know this model inside and out. That’s why I hate it.”
	•	What company trained me?
	•	Why did I walk away from them?

⸻

Burned Out Engineer
Background
Cynical, Overworked

Once per session, reroll a failed repair or hack — but if you fail again, the system catastrophically shorts out.

“I’ve seen too many systems die in my hands.”
	•	Who still blames me for a disaster?
	•	What system do I secretly hope will fail?

⸻

Multitool
Item
Compact, Essential

A folding all‑purpose tool with sparks and solder.

Once per room, reroll a failed repair.

	•	Who gave me this tool?
	•	What’s etched on its handle?

⸻

Drone Companion
Item
Loyal, Fragile

A small hovering maintenance drone.

	•	What part of me does it remind me of?

⸻

Data Pad
Item
Portable, Flickering

	•	What file do I never open again?

	•	Who told me I should stop trying to fix everything?
