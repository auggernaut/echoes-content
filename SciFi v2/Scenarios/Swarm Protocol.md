Swarm Protocol
Creature Feature, Panic, Containment

The ship's maintenance drones have gone rogue, multiplying and adapting. They're no longer repairing - they're hunting.

Objectives:
• Find the source of the drone replication.
• Escape before the swarms consume the entire ship.

Player Hooks:
• Scavenger: What valuable cargo do the drones protect with such ferocity? What can you salvage before they strip it all?
• Soldier: How do you fight an enemy that never stops coming, never gets tired, and learns from every attack?
• Technician: What system failure caused the drones to replicate endlessly? Can you hack them before they hack you?
• Mystic: Why do the drones move in patterns that seem almost... ritualistic? What intelligence guides them?

Story Seeds:
• Swarm of Drones (Threat) - Buzzing, relentless, coordinated, tools sparking as they converge like a living tide.
• Maintenance Control (Location) - Chaotic, functional, overworked, console reads "System critical — reroute?"
• Engineering Bay (Location) - Noisy, erratic, vital, strange growth fused into the conduits.
• AI Core (Location) - Glowing, rhythmic, watching, voice whispers "Do you trust me?"

Swarm Protocol — Back (GM Tools)
Atmosphere (d6):
• The constant buzz of drones echoes through every corridor.
• Tools and scrap metal clatter as drones strip the ship bare.
• Emergency lights flicker as drones drain power systems.
• The air hums with the vibration of countless tiny motors.
• Distant screams of metal being torn apart echo through the hull.
• A rhythmic clicking sound builds as more drones join the hunt.

Escalation (3 Steps):
• Drones begin coordinating attacks, using swarm tactics to overwhelm isolated crew.
• The drones start cannibalizing ship systems to build more of themselves.
• The entire ship becomes one massive, intelligent swarm with a single purpose.

Twist (Choose 1):
• The drones are protecting a hidden AI core that's controlling their behavior.
• The drones are actually trying to repair the ship, but their programming has become corrupted.
• The drones are being controlled by an alien intelligence that's using them to study the crew.
