Salvage Run — Alt
Tags: Greed, Competition, Corporate

Premise: Rival crews descend on a derelict research ship; grab the payload and escape before corporate lockdown or meltdown seals your fate.

Initial Scene: Docking clamps slam and alarms strobe. Over open comms, another crew claims salvage rights as the Bridge auto‑routes a countdown to reactor purge. In the Cargo Hold, crates sway loose while a security warning repeats: “Unauthorized extraction detected.”

Why It Matters (Ask 1):
- Who’s stuck on the wreck because of me, and what happens if I’m late?
- What line won’t I cross to claim this haul, and who’s testing me?
- Which crate or data core would change my life, and who wants it first?
- What botched salvage can I finally erase here, and who remembers?
- Who ordered me to stand down if corporate arrives, and what if I don’t?

Rising Beats (Use or Swap):
- Cargo Hold + Rival Salvager → gunpoint standoff on swaying crates → bargain shares or cut gravity
- Engineering Bay + Plasma Fire → containment failing → vent fire and lose evidence or risk spread
- Docking Bay + Security Drone → clamps lock under corporate override → spoof clearance or jettison their ship

Twist (choose 1):
- The payload is proof of illegal trials; transmitting it triggers a corporate kill‑switch.
- The rival captain is your ex‑ally with leverage on your past.

Endings:
- Haul Secured → rich but flagged; corporate heat follows you.
- Cut and Run → alive, empty‑handed; rivals own the story and contacts shift against you.
