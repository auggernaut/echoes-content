Swarm Cathedral
Tags: Machine Worship, Siege

Premise: Repair drones are “consecrating” the Chapel into a command shrine that will convert ship systems to a new liturgy.

Initial Scene: Alarms chirp in a strange rhythm as bulkheads weld shut with filament. In the Chapel, drones spiral, fusing scrap into a towering lattice. Loudspeakers click: “Consecration at 12%.” A fresh wave pours from vents toward you.

Why It Matters (Ask 1):
- Who is woven into the lattice because of my delay, and how do I make it right?
- What creed do I refuse to let rewrite our systems, and why is that mine to fight?
- What core here would change my fortunes, and which rival is closing in?
- Who ordered me to stand down, and what happens if I don’t?

Rising Beats (Use or Swap):
- Chapel + Swarm of Drones → shrine seals exits → free captives or hold the door
- Maintenance Control + Swarm of Drones → power rerouted to shrine → cut grid sector or lose life‑support
- AI Core + Security Drone → creed broadcast begins → purge firmware or grant admin and risk lockout

Twist (choose 1):
- The “worship” is a hardening protocol: convert all organics to intruders to “save” the ship.
- A crew‑seeded rogue subroutine is the prophet; killing it endangers its creator’s mindprint.

Endings:
- Sanctum Purged → drones scatter; systems flicker; accept disabled subsystems for the session.
- Conversion Contained → Chapel sealed as a holy zone; drones stand down but demand tributes; gain leverage and a persistent complication.
