Cold Supper
Tags: Survival, Predation, Containment

Premise: Ferals hunt the ship as cryo pods misfire and gravity flickers; seal breaches and save survivors before the wreck becomes their larder.

Initial Scene: Weight vanishes—trays and chairs drift in the Mess Hall. A hiss from the Airlock grows into a hungry roar. Over comms: panting, then a whisper—“please—help—” as a Cryo pod thumps open and barefoot steps scrape metal nearby.

Why It Matters (Ask 1):
- Who is trapped in Cryo because of me, and what happens if I’m late?
- What line won’t I cross to save them, and who’s testing me?
- What crate/data here changes my fortunes, and who wants it first?
- What past emergency did I mishandle, and who still remembers?
- Who ordered evacuation, and what if I disobey?

Rising Beats:
- Mess Hall + Ferals Awake → pack floods in → fight through or barricade and leave someone outside
- Airlock + Hull Breach → suction builds → seal and vent a room or lose the corridor
- Armored Corridor + Gravity Fails → gravity spikes and drops → crawl in mag‑boots or drift and risk separation

Twists:
- The ferals follow “food” scent tags baked into crew uniforms; stripping them paints you as prey.
- The Cryo Survivor carries a transponder that calls the pack; it’s lifesaving… and bait.

Endings:
- Breach Sealed → survivors saved; ship limps; ferals scatter into dark decks.
- Cut and Run → you escape with few; the wreck becomes their pantry—and your unfinished business.
