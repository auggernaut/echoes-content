Scenario Title
Tags: theme1, theme2, theme3 (2–3 max)

Premise: [One sentence, ≤25 words. What is happening right now?]

Initial Scene: [30–45 words in medias res. Drop the table into motion with a sight/sound and an immediate pressure.]

Why It Matters (Ask 1):
Rotate across these 5 stake types (pick 3–5 per scenario):
Relationship
- Who here do I owe, and what happens if I fail them?
- Who inside reminds me of someone I lost, and what won’t I risk again?
Moral/Belief
- What vow or taboo does this threaten, and what would breaking it cost me?
- What truth am I trying to prove, and who’s waiting to see me fail?
Resource/Profit
- What singular thing here could change my life, and who wants it first?
- What critical system/resource matters to me personally, and why?
Reputation/Legacy
- What mistake from my record can I finally erase, and who will remember?
- What future story about me do I want told if we survive?
Debt/Order/Obligation
- Who gave me an order I can’t ignore, and what if I disobey?
- Who did I promise to protect, and how close am I to breaking it?

Use 1–2 archetype‑flavored variants sparingly to spice it up:
- Mystic: What vision warned me of this, and what price did it name?
- Scavenger: What payout fixes more than just my problems?
- Soldier: What line can’t I cross again, no matter the cost?
- Technician: What elegant fix will prove I’m more than a wrench?

Rising Beats (Use or Swap):
- [Location] + [Event] → [immediate pressure] → [A or B]
- [Location] + [NPC/Event] → [timer/pressure] → [A or B]
- [Location] + [Event] → [catastrophe setup] → [A or B]

Twist (choose 1):
- [Twist A, one line]
- [Twist B, one line]

Endings:
- [Ending A, one line with cost]
- [Ending B, one line with tradeoff]

Notes:
- Reference Location/Event cards by name only; details live on those cards.
- Keep bullets to one line. Aim for total card word count ~180–220 across front/back.
