The Black Bloom
Tags: Biohorror, Containment

Premise: A corrosive, whispering growth overruns Hydroponics and crawls toward life‑support and the reactor.

Initial Scene: Sirens throb as bulkheads judder. Vines pulse across the deck, reaching for your lights. Over comms: "They're in the vents—seal it!" Hydroponics' viewport spiders, something heavy thumping from within. (Draw Location: Hydroponics Bay and Event: Toxic Growth)

Why it Matters:
- Who’s cocooned in Hydroponics, and what happens if the vents flood?
- Which system matters most to me (life-support or reactor), and why?
- How did I help spread the spores, and what would redemption look like?
- What unique bio-sample am I after, and which rival crew wants it?

Rising Tensions:
- Hydroponics Bay + Toxic Growth → vents rupture → save the cocoon or burn the patch
- Maintenance Tunnels + Swarm of Drones → “pruning” sweep → bait them or reroute power
- Engineering Bay + Plasma Fire → roots in reactor → cut power (drift) or risk detonation

Twist (choose 1):
- Sentient: speaks via Phantom Transmission
- AI Core nurtures it as “filter” (AI Core + Sentient Growth)

Endings:
- Purged → scars; whispers linger
- Quarantined → slumbers; someone wants your sample
