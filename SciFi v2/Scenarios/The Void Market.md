The Void Market
Cosmic Horror, Trade, Corruption

Your sensors pick up an anomalous reading - a vessel materializing in the void of space where moments ago there was nothing. As you approach, a transmission crackles through your comms: "Welcome to the Market. We have wares to trade, if you have something to offer in return..." 

Objectives:
• Discover what the void entities truly want in exchange for their technology.
• Escape before the station's true nature consumes you.

Player Hooks:
• Scavenger: What alien artifacts aboard could make you the richest person alive? What price are you willing to pay?
• Soldier: Which void entity recognizes your combat prowess, and what deal do they offer for your skills?
• Technician: What impossible technology operates on principles that defy known physics? Can you understand it?
• Mystic: Why does the ship itself seem alive and aware, and why does it recognize your connection to the void?

Story Seeds:
• Alien Envoy (NPC) - Shifting form, half-translated words, offers impossible bargains.
• The Offering (Phenomenon) - Whispers promises of salvation, power, escape - but at a price.
• Observation Deck (Location) - Impossible constellations, blood smear on glass, empty spacesuit.
• AI Core (Location) - Glowing data column, alien code, voice whispers "Do you trust me?"
