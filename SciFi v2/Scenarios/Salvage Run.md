Salvage Run
Greed, Competition, Corporate Espionage

A derelict corporate research vessel drifts in contested space. Multiple factions race to claim its valuable cargo before it's destroyed by corporate cleanup teams.

Objectives:
• Secure as much valuable cargo as possible.
• Escape before corporate security forces arrive.

Player Hooks:
• Scavenger: What prototype tech aboard could change your fortunes forever? Who else is racing to claim it?
• Soldier: Which corporate force is coming to seize this ship, and why must you stop them?
• Technician: What classified data could you expose, and who wants to keep it buried?
• Mystic: What void energies call to you from this vessel, and why do they feel familiar?

Story Seeds:
• Rival Salvager (NPC) - Armed, desperate, claims legal rights but hands shake.
• Security Drone (Threat) - Active targeting systems, corporate sentinel, red warning lights.
• Cargo Hold (Location) - Leaking containers, hazard symbols, flickering manifest data.
• Engineering Bay (Location) - Unstable reactor core, pools of coolant, abandoned repairs.

Salvage Run — Back (GM Tools)
Atmosphere (d6):
• The ship's corridors echo with distant footsteps that aren't yours.
• Corporate logos flicker on walls, then fade to reveal older markings.
• The air tastes of ozone and desperation.
• Distant voices argue over comms about salvage rights.
• Emergency lights pulse red, creating a sense of urgency.
• The ship groans as if straining under the weight of its secrets.

Escalation (3 Steps):
• Rival salvagers breach the hull, racing to strip valuable cargo before you can reach it.
• Corporate security vessels lock weapons on the derelict and demand immediate evacuation.
• The reactor core begins critical meltdown sequence - 5 minutes until total ship destruction.

Twist (Choose 1):
• The ship's AI is still active and protecting its cargo with lethal force.
• One of the rival salvagers is a corporate spy sent to recover specific items.
• The prototype technology is unstable and begins affecting the ship's structure.
