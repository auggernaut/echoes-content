🎴 Scavenger Boons (pick 1 at character creation)

⸻

Loot Expert
Boon
Greedy, Sharp‑Eyed

“If there’s something worth taking, I’ll find it first.”

When searching for valuables, hidden stashes, or salvageable gear, roll +1d6 and keep the highest.

Prompts:
	•	What treasure do I still dream of finding again?
	•	Who did I once beat to a prize — and made an enemy for life?

⸻

Improviser
Boon
Clever, Resourceful

“I can make anything into something useful — or dangerous.”

When using junk, scraps, or improvised tools/weapons, roll +1d6 and keep the highest.

Prompts:
	•	What’s the strangest thing I ever turned into a weapon?
	•	Who still owes me because of my ingenuity?

⸻

Scrapwork Survivor
Boon
Tough, Pragmatic

“I survive on grit and garbage. Always have.”

When attempting survival tasks (scavenging food, bracing wounds, jury‑rigging shelter), roll +1d6 and keep the highest.

Prompts:
	•	What near‑death scrape taught me these skills?
	•	Who calls me a vulture — and who calls me a hero?

⸻


Duck and Weave
Defense
Quick, Slippery

“I don’t block hits. I make sure they don’t land.”

When targeted by an attack, roll a d6. On 5+, you slip aside and avoid the Strike.

Prompts:
	•	Who always tells me to “stand still for once”?
	•	What scar reminds me I wasn’t fast enough?

⸻

Cover Rat

When in a room with cover (crates, walls, debris), roll a d6. On 4+, a Strike that hits you instead shatters the cover.

Prompts:
	•	What junk do I always duck behind?
	•	Who calls me a coward — but owes me their life?

⸻

Play Dead
Defense
Sneaky, Desperate

“Sometimes the smartest move is not moving at all.”

Once per fight, you may avoid a Strike entirely by dropping prone and feigning death. Enemies ignore you until you act again.

	•	What’s the worst thing I’ve seen while pretending to be dead?

⸻

Jury‑Rig

Once per scene, you can cobble together a temporary tool or weapon from scraps. It works for one use, then breaks.

	•	What's the strangest thing I've ever built?
	•	Who first taught me this trick?

⸻

Loot Rat
Ability
Greedy, Opportunistic

Once per room, you may ask the GM: "What here is valuable?" They must answer truthfully.

"If it's not nailed down, it's mine. If it is, I've got the tools."
	•	What's the one treasure I'll never part with?
	•	Who did I betray to get it?

⸻

Salvage Instinct
Ability
Greedy, Reckless

When loot is on the line, you may roll twice and keep the better result on risky actions.

"I can smell profit like blood in the water."
	•	What loot have I risked too much for?
	•	Who still wants their share from me?

⸻

Scrapshield
Ability
Protective, Improvised

Once per session, you can throw together a junk barricade, giving yourself or an ally +1 temporary Hit.

"A wall of junk is better than no wall at all."
	•	What scar reminds me my shields don't always hold?
	•	Who do I always shield first?

⸻

Ex‑Corporate Cleaner
Background
Corporate, Secretive

Once per game, you may declare a syndicate or corporation secretly tied to this wreck. The GM adds an Event connected to them.

	•	What job finally made me walk away?
	•	Who still wants me dead for it?

	•	What mark did I leave with these?
	•	Who fears me because of them?

⸻

Scavenger's Bag
Item
Useful, Clattering

Once per session, pull out a useful mundane item (rope, crowbar, duct tape). The GM decides its limits.

"Everything useful fits in here — eventually."
	•	What's the weirdest thing I've pulled from it?
	•	What item do I refuse to use?

⸻

Lucky Trinket
Item
Fragile, Personal

Once per game, reroll any failed roll. The trinket breaks afterward.

"Every time I think I'm finished, this charm gets me through."
	•	Who gave it to me?
	•	What do I see in it that no one else does?

⸻

Carrion Reputation
Background
Infamous, Respected

Once per session, you may claim scavenger's rights, taking an item or resource even if contested. NPCs react poorly, but other scavengers respect you.
