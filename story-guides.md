## The Hook: Why You're Here

Two years ago, the crimson castle appeared for one night in a quiet village near the edge of the moor. Dozens vanished. The manor's blood pools overflowed. In the aftermath, only silence remained—except for one name: **Seleana Suantis**.

A fierce vampire hunter, Seleana entered the manor alone to slay the Blood King and avenge those who were sacrificed. She never returned.

Some say she died in the attempt. Others claim she still lives within, hardened by horror, twisted by necessity—and waiting for the right moment to strike.

> **Who among you is determined to find Seleana—whether to rescue her, put her to rest, or settle a personal debt?**  
> **How did you come to know her name, and what does she mean to you?**

## 🧰 GM Tips

- **📦 Don't worry about order.** Let the players explore however they want.
- **🔁 Use the scenes as modular moments.** Drop them in when the pacing calls for it.
- **🩸 Let the cards do the work.** Describe from their prompts, reframe with your story.
- **🎭 Keep the tone lush, slow, and dangerous.** Everyone is watching. Everyone has a plan.
- **🗝️ Use new rooms and threats.** The Hat Room, Guest Room, Corridors, Dining Room, Kitchen, and Blood Prisoners all offer new story hooks and dangers.

> You don't need a full map. Just imagine the camera following velvet, blood, and candlelight… and ask: "Who's watching them now?"
