## Setting the Hook

A bleeding moon rises. The castle that shouldn’t be there… is. Ancient, shifting, alive.

Masked nobles arrive in cursed carriages. The Blood King has summoned his patrons—vampires, shapeshifters, immortal guests of honor—for a once-in-a-century rite. Whispers say he's ascending to godhood.

The players were *not* invited. But someone they love is already inside.

> “The Blood King drinks his guests last. You may still have time.”

## Scene 1: The Gates Await You

Thorned **Blood Roses** line the black path. As the players approach, the manor doors open on their own.  
A statue with an outstretched hand waits beside a coat hanger soaked in old blood.  
Two **Servants of the Veil**, eyeless and smiling, whisper:

> “Welcome, honored guests. May your blood be worthy.”

- If the players use or forge an invitation, the statue accepts it.
- Without it, an alarm is delayed 1d6 turns before Blood Thrall Guards arrive.

## Scene 2: The House Breathes

The manor is a labyrinth of velvet, bone, and dripping walls. The deeper the players go, the more it remembers them.

Let them explore freely. Use these scenes as needed.

### 📖 The Library of the Forgotten

### 🍷 The Feeding Chamber

## 🧰 GM Tips

- **📦 Don’t worry about order.** Let the players explore however they want.
- **🔁 Use the scenes as modular moments.** Drop them in when the pacing calls for it.
- **🩸 Let the cards do the work.** Describe from their prompts, reframe with your story.
- **🎭 Keep the tone lush, slow, and dangerous.** Everyone is watching. Everyone has a plan.

> You don’t need a full map. Just imagine the camera following velvet, blood, and candlelight… and ask: “Who’s watching them now?”
