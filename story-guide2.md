## The Hook: Why You're Here

The invitation arrived on your doorstep one morning, written in elegant script on aged parchment. It bore no return address, only the words: "You are cordially invited to the Annual Garden Party at Rosewood Manor. Please bring your memories."

None of you remember attending such a party before. None of you recognize the manor's name. Yet something in the invitation feels... familiar. Like a dream you've had a hundred times but can never quite recall upon waking.

The manor stands at the edge of town, where it has always stood—though no one can remember when it was built, or who lives there now. The garden parties are legendary, they say. The most beautiful people attend. The most interesting conversations happen. And no one ever leaves quite the same.

> **What memory did you bring to the party?**  
> **Why does this invitation feel like it was meant for you specifically?**

## 🎭 Scene-Based Story Reveal

### Scene 1: The Arrival at the Gates

**What the Players Experience:**  
They approach the manor under a perpetual twilight. The Biting Gate groans as they near. Blood roses bloom unnaturally, their petals falling like tears. Blood Thrall Guards demand invitations, and the threat of the Biting Gate is ever-present.

**What the GM Reveals Here:**  
> The manor exists outside of normal time. The party has been happening for decades—centuries, perhaps.  
> The guests are not entirely alive, nor entirely dead. They are memories given form.  
> The gate itself is alive and hungry, and the Blood Thrall Guards are under a trance.

**Reveal Through:**  
The gate's rusted iron seems to whisper names. The blood roses turn toward you as you pass. Blood Thrall Guards at the gate. The Biting Gate's teeth grinding as it senses unwelcome guests. The Vine Fence encircles the property, with a skeleton and holy water hidden near a twisted opening.

### Scene 2: The Guilded Entry Hall

**What the Players Experience:**  
Past the Biting Gate, stout oak doors painted gold stand open. A dwarven statue with an outstretched hand greets visitors. The air is thick with the mingling scents of perfume and blood. Bloodstained coats hang on a rack, and the statue seems to expect an offering.

**What the GM Reveals Here:**  
> The entry hall is a security checkpoint. The statue can trigger or delay alarms.  
> Disguises and extra invitations can be found among the coats.  
> Proceeding without appeasing the statue may summon Blood Thrall Guards.

**Reveal Through:**  
A coat with an extra invitation. A finely crafted, bat-shaped gold pin. The statue's hand waiting for an invitation. The distant sound of an alarm if the players proceed carelessly.

### Scene 3: The Great Hall Gathering

**What the Players Experience:**  
A grand hall filled with elegant guests in period dress. The throne sits empty, but everyone acts as if someone sits there. Music plays from nowhere. The monstrous doors behind are adorned with red metal veins, alive and pumping blood. The spiral staircase winds up from the corner.

**What the GM Reveals Here:**  
> The guests are memories of people who attended previous parties. They repeat the same conversations, the same dances, the same tragedies.  
> The throne belongs to the Memory Keeper—the entity that preserves these moments forever.  
> Destroying the throne reveals a golden coffin of immense value.

**Reveal Through:**  
A guest who recognizes you from "last year's party." Conversations that loop and repeat. The way shadows move independently of their casters. NPCs watching the throne. The spiral staircase leading up. The golden throne's hidden secrets. The monstrous doors' reaction to the unnatural.

### Scene 4: The Banshee's Lament

**What the Players Experience:**  
A spectral noblewoman wanders the halls, her jewelry catching light that shouldn't exist. She sings a lullaby that makes everyone weep.

**What the GM Reveals Here:**  
> The Banshee is the Memory Keeper's first guest—his wife, preserved in her moment of greatest sorrow.  
> She remembers more than the others. She knows what the manor really is.  
> Her ring bears the crest of the manor's original owners, before the Memory Keeper took it.

**Reveal Through:**  
Her song contains hidden messages. Her jewelry shows scenes from the manor's past. She speaks of a "before time" when memories were allowed to fade. Her wail inflicts banes. She disappears if attacked, haunting the aggressor until soothed.

### Scene 5: Exploring the Manor

**What the Players Experience:**  
Players can explore various rooms:
- **Hat Room:** Walls adorned with hats and mirrors, one shattered. Magical effects possible from hats. Mirrors may reveal the name of a trapped soul.
- **Guest Room:** A regal bed, a marble-topped dresser with a silver mirror, and a closet with hidden compartments. Magickal items can be found with careful searching.
- **Corridors:** Stained red carpet, paintings that seem to move, statues frozen in terror, and blood pulsing through the walls.
- **Dining Room:** A grand table set with ghastly dishes, a golden chandelier, and the sound of muffled screams from the kitchen. Blood Servants replace dishes and ignore PCs unless attacked.
- **Kitchen:** Bloodied tables, caged prisoners, and the Blood Extractor device. Blood Prisoners react in various ways if engaged.

**What the GM Reveals Here:**  
> Each room holds secrets, dangers, and opportunities for discovery.  
> The manor is alive with blood magic and hidden threats.  
> The Mirrored Soul may reveal hidden knowledge or disrupt enemies if engaged.

### Scene 6: The Vine Fence Boundary

**What the Players Experience:**  
A massive fence of barbed wire and dark vines encircles the property. Beyond it, the world seems to fade into mist.

**What the GM Reveals Here:**  
> The fence marks the boundary of the Memory Keeper's domain. Beyond it lies the real world, where time flows normally.  
> The vines are the Memory Keeper's roots, drawing sustenance from the memories of his guests.  
> The skeleton near the hole is someone who tried to escape—and failed.

**Reveal Through:**  
The vines pulse with a heartbeat. The skeleton's belongings tell a story of desperation. The hole in the fence seems to be healing itself.

### Scene 7: The Memory Harvest

**What the Players Experience:**  
They discover the true purpose of the party: the Memory Keeper is collecting precious memories to sustain his eternal existence.

**What the GM Reveals Here:**  
> Each guest brings a memory that the Keeper finds beautiful or tragic enough to preserve.  
> Once shared, the memory becomes part of the manor's eternal collection—and the guest becomes part of the party forever.  
> The Keeper believes he's doing them a favor by preserving their most precious moments.

**Reveal Through:**  
A guest willingly sharing their memory and fading into the wallpaper. The way the manor's decorations change to reflect new memories. The Keeper's genuine confusion when guests resist.

### Scene 8: The Choice

**What the Players Experience:**  
The Memory Keeper appears, offering them a choice: share their memories and become eternal guests, or leave and forget everything they've learned.

**What the GM Reveals Here:**  
> The Memory Keeper is not evil—he's lonely. He was once human, but chose to preserve his happiest moment forever.  
> He cannot understand why anyone would choose to let their memories fade.  
> The manor will continue to exist whether they stay or go, but their choice will change its nature.

**Reveal Through:**  
The Keeper's own memories of being human. The way the manor responds to their emotions. The Banshee's final plea for release.

### Scene 9: The Aftermath

**What the Players Experience:**  
Their choice determines the manor's future—and their own. Blood Prisoners may be freed or left behind. The manor's fate is decided.

**What the GM Concludes Here:**  
> If they stay: They become part of the eternal party, their memories preserved forever.  
> If they leave: The manor fades from their memory, but they carry the knowledge of what they've seen.  
> If they destroy the Keeper: The manor crumbles, releasing all the trapped memories into the world.

**Reveal Through:**  
The reactions of freed prisoners. The state of the manor. The fate of the Memory Keeper.

## 🧰 GM Tips

- **📦 Let the manor feel alive.** The walls breathe, the shadows move, the memories whisper.
- **🔁 Use the cards as memory fragments.** Each location holds echoes of past parties and forgotten guests.
- **🩸 Focus on the melancholy.** This is a story about the beauty and pain of holding onto the past.
- **🎭 Keep the tone gentle but unsettling.** The horror comes from the realization that nothing here is quite real.
- **🗝️ Use new rooms and threats.** The Hat Room, Guest Room, Corridors, Dining Room, Kitchen, and Blood Prisoners all offer new story hooks and dangers.

> Remember: the Memory Keeper believes he's helping. The tragedy is that he's trapped everyone in a beautiful prison of their own making.
