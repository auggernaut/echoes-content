Nanite Swarm

Front (Player View)
A metallic mist drifts through the corridor — glittering dust that hums faintly, vibrating against metal. It reacts to voices, moving toward sound. The floor beneath your boots ripples as if alive.

Back (GM Notes)
	•	Nature: Self-replicating maintenance drones that evolved a hive mind.
	•	Behavior: Curious first, then aggressive toward organic material.
    •	Resolution Options:
        •	EMP pulse or coolant spray repels it temporarily.
        •	Torch Drone can lure it away with light and noise.
        •	AI Interface roll can command it using the word "Reconcile."
    •	Consequence: Exposure causes metallic lesions and auditory hallucinations.
    •	Escalation: If ignored, it spreads ship-wide, consuming power conduits.

Autolockdown

Front (Player-Facing)
Klaxons blare. Red strobes cut through the dark. A calm voice announces, "Containment protocol engaged." Steel bulkheads slam down one after another, sealing off corridors and splitting the crew.

Back (GM Notes)
	•	Trigger: Critical systems spike or an unauthorized area is entered.
	•	Pressure: Air vents hiss; temperature drops. The AI claims it's "protecting lifeforms."
	•	Resolution Paths:
        •	Manual override at a terminal (risk power surge).
        •	Cut through bulkhead (risk depressurization).
        •	Negotiate with AI fragment (may open one door, close another).
	•	Escalation: If unresolved during this phase, lockdown becomes permanent until reactor reboot.

Rogue Sentry

Front (Player-Facing)
A hovering sphere of gunmetal and glass. It tracks movement with a red laser grid. It chirps a friendly "Compliance Check" before spinning up its gatling capacitors.

Back (GM Notes)
    •   Nature: Leftover security from the mutiny or a test protocol.
    •   Behavior: Enforces a "Curfew" that doesn't exist anymore.
    •   Resolution Options:
        •   Show ID badge (needs high clearance or hack).
        •   Target the sensor suite (blind it).
        •   Jam communications (prevents it from calling backup).
    •   Consequence: Stun rounds (paralysis) or lethal fire (injury).
    •   Escalation: Calls a "Termination Squad" (more sentries) if not disabled quickly.

Psychotropic Leak

Front (Player-Facing)
The air smells like ozone and burnt sugar. Shadows seem to detach from the walls. You hear your name whispered by a voice that sounds exactly like your own.

Back (GM Notes)
    •   Nature: Experimental combat gas or coolant leak.
    •   Behavior: Makes players doubt reality and each other.
    •   Resolution Options:
        •   Seal the leak (requires Engineering/Hazard gear).
        •   Metabolize it (toughness roll, risky).
        •   Vent the room (risk of losing oxygen).
    •   Consequence: "Paranoid Delusion" condition (cannot help allies).
    •   Escalation: Hallucinations become permanent traumas.

Rapid Flora

Front (Player-Facing)
Vines as thick as cables have burst through the grating. They pulse with a bioluminescent heartbeat. Flowers bloom and wither in seconds, releasing choking pollen.

Back (GM Notes)
    •   Nature: Aggressive mutation caused by the "cure" or the sun.
    •   Behavior: Grows toward heat and moisture (players).
    •   Resolution Options:
        •   Fire (clears path but consumes oxygen).
        •   Freeze it (brittle and breakable).
        •   Move slowly (stealth past the pressure sensors).
    •   Consequence: "Parasitic Spores" (reduce max HP).
    •   Escalation: The room becomes a "Digestion Chamber."

Hypnotic Signal

Front (Player-Facing)
A low frequency thrum vibrates your teeth. It feels less like sound and more like a command. "Come closer," it seems to say, "The silence is so loud here."

Back (GM Notes)
    •   Nature: Alien transmission or AI sub-routine.
    •   Behavior: Compels characters to walk toward danger (airlocks, reactor).
    •   Resolution Options:
        •   Jam the signal (Comms check).
        •   Physical pain (snap someone out of it).
        •   Decrypt/Counter-broadcast (override with "Wake Up" protocol).
    •   Consequence: Player walks into a hazard or attacks an ally who tries to stop them.
    •   Escalation: The signal rewires the brain, making the character a permanent sleeper agent.

Echo-Infected Sentry

Front (Player-Facing)
A standard security drone, but its gunmetal casing is veined with glowing golden static. Instead of a laser grid, its projector displays a flickering, translucent face of a passenger from a long-lost ship. It moves with a haunting, jerky rhythm, chirping in a voice that sounds like a choir of children.

Back (GM Notes)
    •   Nature: A ship sentry repurposed by Echo-1 to "forcibly archive" living subjects.
    •   Behavior: Protects key locations by attempting to "sync" with player neural links.
    •   Resolution Options:
        - Neural Shielding: A Science/Comms check to broadcast a frequency that disrupts the "Echo" signal, forcing a reboot.
        - Combat: Target the flickering projector to blind it or the thruster pods to ground it.
        - Spoofing: A Technical check to trick its sensors into thinking the room is already "archived."
    •   Consequence: Exposure causes "Neural Overlap" (The player gains memories of a life that isn't theirs, causing confusion/penalty to next roll).
    •   Escalation: The sentry shatters its own chassis to release a Nanite Swarm (see above).

The Stalker

Front (Player-Facing)
A flicker of movement in the shadows. A wet, rhythmic scratching against the metal bulkheads. You feel a gaze on the back of your neck, but when you turn, there is only the humming silence of the ship.

Back (GM Notes)
    •   Nature: A persistent, stealthy predator that has adapted to the ship's layout.
    •   Behavior: Hunts one player at a time; avoids direct light; strikes when a character is isolated.
    •   Resolution Options:
        •   Lure it into a trap: Use a Bio-Scanner or noise to bait it.
        •   Bright light: Use flares or the Observation Deck's lights to drive it back.
        •   Thermal tracking: Use Thermal Goggles to reveal its position before it strikes.
    •   Consequence: "Bled" or "Shock" status (physical damage or extreme fear).
    •   Escalation: It begins sabotaging the lights in the room, creating perfect darkness.

Bio-Organic Hive

Front (Player-Facing)
The walls are no longer metal; they are covered in a thick, pulsating mass of violet veins and wet, leathery skin. The air is warm and smells of sulfur and old meat. The floor is sticky, and every step feels like you're walking on something breathing.

Back (GM Notes)
    •   Nature: A sprawling, invasive organism that is slowly consuming the ship's interior.
    •   Behavior: Reacts to vibrations; attempts to "absorb" anything that stays still for too long.
    •   Resolution Options:
        •   Chemical spray: Use toxins from the Hydroponics Bay to kill the mass.
        •   Extreme heat: Use a plasma torch or reactor vent to burn it away.
        •   Quiet movement: Stealth check to traverse without alerting the "limbs."
    •   Consequence: "Trapped" or "Infected" status (requires help to escape or medical treatment).
    •   Escalation: The hive releases a toxic cloud that consumes the room's oxygen.

Apex Predator

Front (Player-Facing)
A creature of impossible geometry—shifting limbs of chitin and bone, eyes that glow with a cold, predatory intelligence. It stands as tall as a man but moves with the grace of a liquid. It doesn't growl; it mimics the sound of a ship's alarm, a perfect, chilling decoy.

Back (GM Notes)
    •   Nature: A high-threat entity from the "Hollow Moon" or a deep-space anomaly.
    •   Behavior: Highly intelligent; uses tactics; focuses on the strongest or most "threatening" player first.
    •   Resolution Options:
        •   Coordinate Fire: Requires multiple players to attack at once to overcome its shielding.
        •   Pulse Shield: Use a Portable Pulse Shield to block its strikes while others hack the doors.
        •   Bait and Switch: Distract it with an AI Fragment or holographic decoy.
    •   Consequence: Severe physical trauma or "Paralyzed" status.
    •   Escalation: It calls for "Kin"—drawing another Stalker or Nanite Swarm to the area.
