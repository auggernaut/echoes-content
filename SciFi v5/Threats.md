## 💀 Biological & Xenomorphic

### The Stalker
**Front (Player-Facing)**
A flicker of movement in the shadows. A wet, rhythmic scratching against the metal bulkheads. You feel a gaze on the back of your neck, but when you turn, there is only the humming silence of the ship.
*   **Strikes:** 2
*   **To Hit:** 4+ (5+ in bright light)
*   **Boons:** +1d6 to Stealth, +1d6 to Climbing.

    *   **Shadow Meld:** Can vanish into any non-illuminated area as a free action.
*   **Behavior:** Avoids groups; strikes the tail of the party; flees if it takes 1 Strike.

### Apex Predator
**Front (Player-Facing)**
A creature of impossible geometry—shifting limbs of chitin and bone, eyes that glow with a cold, predatory intelligence. It stands as tall as a man but moves with the grace of a liquid. It doesn't growl; it mimics the sound of a ship's alarm, a perfect, chilling decoy.
*   **Strikes:** 5
*   **To Hit:** 3+
*   **Boons:** +2d6 to Intimidation, +1d6 to Melee.

    *   **Multi-Strike:** Can attack two different targets in one action.
*   **Behavior:** Focuses on the most armored target first to prove dominance.

### Bio-Organic Hive
**Front (Player-Facing)**
The walls are no longer metal; they are covered in a thick, pulsating mass of violet veins and wet, leathery skin. The air is warm and smells of sulfur and old meat. The floor is sticky, and every step feels like you're walking on something breathing.
*   **Strikes:** 10 (Central Core)
*   **To Hit:** 6+ (Stationary)
*   **Boons:** None.
*   **Resistances:** Immune to piercing/bullets; Double damage from Fire.
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Entangle:** Any player ending their turn in the Hive's room must roll Agility 4+ or become *Restrained*.
    *   **Toxic Pulse:** Once every 3 turns, releases a cloud. Roll Toughness 5+ or take 1 Strike.
*   **Behavior:** Passive until a vibration is felt, then attempts to absorb everything in the room.

### Rapid Flora
**Front (Player-Facing)**
Vines as thick as cables have burst through the grating. They pulse with a bioluminescent heartbeat. Flowers bloom and wither in seconds, releasing choking pollen.
*   **Strikes:** 3
*   **To Hit:** 5+
*   **Boons:** +1d6 to Entangling/Grappling.
*   **Resistances:** Immune to Cold; Double damage from Fire.

*   **Behavior:** Grows toward heat and moisture. Stationary but reaches across zones.

## 🤖 Mechanical & Automated

### Rogue Sentry
**Front (Player-Facing)**
A hovering sphere of gunmetal and glass. It tracks movement with a red laser grid. It chirps a friendly "Compliance Check" before spinning up its gatling capacitors.
*   **Strikes:** 1
*   **To Hit:** 5+
*   **Boons:** +1d6 to Perception (Scanners).
*   **Resistances:** None.
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Compliance Check:** Fires a flash-strobe. Targets roll Agility 4+ or lose their next move.
    *   **Call for Backup:** If not destroyed in its first turn of combat, it summons another Sentry.
*   **Behavior:** Enforces a non-existent curfew. Moves in predictable patrol loops.

### Automated Turret
**Front (Player-Facing)**
Sleek, black cylinders descend from the ceiling on hydraulic tracks. They swivel with a mechanical whine, their sensors painting the room with a grid of red targeting lasers. A voice chimes: "Unauthorized lifeforms detected. Please remain still for elimination."
*   **Strikes:** 2
*   **To Hit:** 4+
*   **Boons:** +2d6 to Ranged (Targeting Computer).
*   **Resistances:** Armored Housing (Ignore Strikes from non-heavy weapons on a d6 roll of 5+).
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Suppressive Tracking:** Once a target is hit, the turret gains +1d6 to hit that target until they break line of sight.
    *   **Area Denial:** Can split its fire to target a 10ft zone instead of an individual.
*   **Behavior:** Stationary. Only fires if sensors detect movement faster than a slow walk.

### Echo-Infected Sentry
**Front (Player-Facing)**
A standard security drone, but its gunmetal casing is veined with glowing golden static. Instead of a laser grid, its projector displays a flickering, translucent face of a passenger from a long-lost ship. It moves with a haunting, jerky rhythm, chirping in a voice that sounds like a choir of children.
*   **Strikes:** 2
*   **To Hit:** 4+
*   **Boons:** +1d6 to Will (Corrupted AI).
*   **Resistances:** Digital Shielding (Immune to hacking unless a Memory Shard is used).
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Memory Flash:** Forces a player to see a vision of a dead passenger. Roll Will 5+ or take a -1d6 penalty to all actions next turn.
    *   **Shatter:** When destroyed, it explodes into a *Nanite Swarm*.
*   **Behavior:** Haunting, jerky rhythm. Often protects "sentimental" ship locations.

### Nanite Swarm
**Front (Player-Facing)**
A metallic mist drifts through the corridor — glittering dust that hums faintly, vibrating against metal. It reacts to voices, moving toward sound. The floor beneath your boots ripples as if alive.
*   **Strikes:** 3 (Requires Area-of-Effect or specific counter)
*   **To Hit:** 4+ (Automatic if engulfed)
*   **Boons:** +2d6 to Stealth.
*   **Resistances:** Immune to physical projectiles/melee.
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Consume Grid:** Deals 1 Strike per turn to anyone inside the cloud.
    *   **Replicate:** If the swarm consumes an electronic item, it heals 1 Strike.
*   **Behavior:** Follows the loudest sound or strongest electrical signal.

## 👥 Humanoid Threats

### Boarding Party (Elite Soldier)
**Front (Player-Facing)**
The ship groans as a magnetic docking tube slams against the hull. The hiss of a cutting torch precedes the heavy thud of armored boots. Voices on the other side of the door are professional, clipped, and calling out tactical positions.
*   **Strikes:** 2
*   **To Hit:** 4+
*   **Boons:** +1d6 to Melee, +1d6 to Planning/Tactics.
*   **Resistances:** Tactical Armor (Ignore the first Strike taken from small arms).
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Flash-Bang:** Once per fight, forces all players in the room to roll Agility 5+ or be *Blinded* for 1 turn.
    *   **Squad Tactics:** If two or more Boarders are in the same room, they roll +1d6 to all attacks.
*   **Behavior:** Moves in formation; uses cover; prioritizes non-combatant targets first.

## 🌫️ Environmental Phenomena (Hazard Stats)


### Psychotropic Leak
**Front (Player-Facing)**
The air smells like ozone and burnt sugar. Shadows seem to detach from the walls. You hear your name whispered by a voice that sounds exactly like your own.
*   **Strikes:** N/A
*   **To Hit:** Will TN 6
*   **Effect:** On failure, player gains the *Paranoid* condition and cannot help allies for the scene.

### Breached Bulkhead
**Front (Player-Facing)**
A jagged tear in the hull shows the terrifying, silent beauty of the void. Loose objects are being sucked toward the frost-rimmed gap. The emergency shutters have jammed halfway, and the roar of escaping air is deafening.
*   **Strikes:** N/A (Structural)
*   **To Hit:** Agility TN 6 (to avoid being pulled)
*   **Effect:** Suction pulls characters 1 zone toward the breach each turn. 0 Oxygen in the zone.

### Autolockdown
**Front (Player-Facing)**
Klaxons blare. Red strobes cut through the dark. A calm voice announces, "Containment protocol engaged." Steel bulkheads slam down one after another, sealing off corridors and splitting the crew.
*   **Strikes:** N/A (Systemic)
*   **To Hit:** Technical/Security TN 6 (to bypass)
*   **Effect:** Sealing bulkheads divide the crew. Failure to bypass causes *Trapped* status.

### Hypnotic Signal
**Front (Player-Facing)**
A low frequency thrum vibrates your teeth. It feels less like sound and more like a command. "Come closer," it seems to say, "The silence is so loud here."
*   **Strikes:** N/A (Signal)
*   **To Hit:** Will TN 6 (to resist)
*   **Effect:** On failure, player moves 1 zone toward the nearest hazard (airlock/reactor) each turn until snapped out of it by a Strike or an ally.
