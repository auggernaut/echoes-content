# 📖 Beginner Adventure: The Stalker's Shadow

This adventure is designed for a first-time GM running the **EZd6** system. It follows a classic "Monster Hunt" structure, introducing mechanics one by one: **Basic Rolls** (Scene 1), **Boons & Items** (Scene 2), **Stealth & Tension** (Scene 3), and finally **Combat** (Scene 4).

## 🎭 Adventure Background (GM Only)
An escaped biological specimen (an **Apex Predator** or **Stalker**) is loose on the ship. It has claimed the **Cargo Hold** as its nest. It is hunting the crew one by one. The players must track it, lure it, and kill it before it kills them.

## 🧩 Global Mechanic: How to Play (GM Read First)
**The Core Rule**: Players describe what they want to do. If it's risky or difficult, ask them to roll.
1.  **The Roll**: The standard roll is **1d6**. They need to roll a **target number** (usually a 4, 5, or 6) to succeed.
2.  **Boons & Banes**:
    *   **Boon**: If they have a Skill, Item, or Advantage that helps (e.g., "I use my *Scanner* to track it"), give them an extra die. They keep the highest result.
    *   **Bane**: If the task is extra hard or they are hindered (e.g., "It's pitch black"), they roll 2d6 and take the lowest result.
3.  **Hero Dice**: Players have limit "Karma" or "Hero Dice" (check their sheets) they can spend to re-roll failures.
4.  **Card Rules**: If a player wants to use a specific ability on their Character Card (like *Bulwark Stance* or *Triage*), let them read the card aloud. If it fits the situation, say "Yes!"

## 🎬 Scene 1: The Observation Deck
**Tags**: Silent, Expansive, Star-lit
**Location Card**: [Observation Deck](file:///Users/home/Dev/git/echoes-content/SciFi%20v5/Locations.md)

### 1. The Scene
> **"The ship's hum is quiet here. The massive viewport looks out onto a field of distant stars. But something is wrong. The usually pristine glass is smeared with a thick, translucent slime. At the center of the room, a table is overturned, and a trail of shiny objects—wrenches, datapads, silverware—leads off toward the maintenance vents."**

### 2. The Situation
The players are safe here, but they need to realize they are being hunted. This scene teaches **Observation**.

### 3. Player Actions & GM Responses
- **If the Security Officer checks the perimeter**: *"I want to check the door for forced entry."*
    *   **GM Response**: "Roll a d6. You need a 4+ to see the details."
    *   **Result**: If they succeed, they find deep claw marks gouged into the steel. *Establish the physical strength of the threat.*
- **If the Engineer examines the slime**: *"I want to analyze this goo."*
    *   **GM Response**: "That sounds tricky. Roll a d6. If you use your *Bio-Scanner*, take a **Boon** (roll 2d6 and keep the highest)."
    *   **Result**: It's bio-luminescent residue. It tracks movement. If they touch it, it glows bright blue.
- **If anyone fails a roll**: Don't just say "nothing happens." Say: *"You step in the slime by accident. It glows bright blue, revealing your position."*

### 4. Moving Forward
**Specialist Aris** drops from a ceiling vent (scaring them). She ignores the slime and points her rifle down the dark corridor. *"It's heading to the Cargo Hold. It likes the cold. If we don't seal it in, it'll start breeding."*

## 🎬 Scene 2: The Maintenance Gut
**Tags**: Cramped, dark, steam-filled
**Location Card**: [Maintenance Gut](file:///Users/home/Dev/git/echoes-content/SciFi%20v5/Locations.md)

### 1. The Scene
> **"You squeeze into the narrow walls of the ship's spine. Steam hisses from broken pipes, obscuring your vision. The floor grating vibrates with the engine's thrum. Ahead, a single red emergency light blinks. Underneath it, you see a leg—a human leg, wearing a grey jumpsuit."**

### 2. The Situation
This scene teaches **Investigation** and **Tech Use**. The body is a trap, or at least a warning.

### 3. Player Actions & GM Responses
- **If the Survivor checks the body**: It's a decoy. A jumpsuit stuffed with wire and insulation. But inside the pocket is a **Universal Multi-Tool**.
    *   **GM Rule**: Tell them *"This Item counts as a Boon for any repair tasks later."*
- **If the Engineer fixes the lights**: *"I try to re-route the power cables."*
    *   **GM Response**: "This is Hard. Roll with a **Bane** (roll 2d6, keep the lowest) to see if you can bypass the fried circuits."
    *   **Failure (1-3)**: Sparks fly! They take 1 Strike of damage. The lights flicker but stay dim.
    *   **Success (4-6)**: The lights buzz on, revealing the path ahead is covered in sticky webbing.
- **If Aris uses her Ocular Implant**: *"I'm picking up a heat signature. It's massive. And it's waiting for us."*

### 4. Moving Forward
They reach the heavy blast doors of the Cargo Hold. They are locked. The Engineer or Security officer must work together to pry them open, or hack the panel. As the door screeches open, a low growl shakes the floor plates.

**Tags**: Cavernous, Echoing, Shadowy
**Location Card**: [Cargo Hold](file:///Users/home/Dev/git/echoes-content/SciFi%20v5/Locations.md)

### 1. The Scene
> **"The Cargo Hold is a canyon of stacked crates and shipping containers. It's freezing in here. The lights are dead. The only illumination comes from the strobe of Aris's rifle. Somewhere in the dark rafters, forty feet up, you hear claws scraping against metal. It knows you're here."**

### 2. The Situation
The creature is stalking them. This scene teaches **Stealth** and **Action Economy**.

### 3. The Encounter: The Stalker
**Threat Card**: [The Stalker](file:///Users/home/Dev/git/echoes-content/SciFi%20v5/Threats.md)

- **The Stalker attacks from above**: It drops onto a crate near the **Medic**. Reading the *Threat Card*, tell the GM: *"It has 2 Strikes to kill. It rolls a d6 to hit you on a 4+."*
- **Player Turn**:
    - **Security**: *"I fire my pulse rifle!"*
        *   **GM**: "Roll a d6 to hit! If you use your *Trained Marksman* ability, take a **Boon**."
        *   **Hit**: The creature shrieks and leaps back into the shadows. (Mark 1 Strike on the monster).
    - **Engineer**: *"I try to hide!"*
        *   **GM**: "Roll a d6 to beat a 4."
        *   **Success**: The creature ignores them and targets someone else.
    - **Medic**: *"I scan it to find a weak point!"*
        *   **GM**: "Do you have a scanner? Yes? Take a Boon."
        *   **Success**: You realize its skin is sensitive to **Heat**.

### 4. Moving Forward
Aris shouts: *"We can't kill it in the dark! Inspect the container cranes! Drive it toward the Reactor Core!"* The players must make a fighting retreat, holding off the creature while moving to the exit.

## 🎬 Scene 4: The Reactor Core (Finale)
**Tags**: Roaring, Blindingly Hot, Dangerous
**Location Card**: [Reactor Core](file:///Users/home/Dev/git/echoes-content/SciFi%20v5/Locations.md)

### 1. The Scene
> **"You burst into the Reactor chamber. The heat hits you like a hammer. In the center of the room, the blue-white pillar of the drive core is spinning. The creature bursts through the door behind you, screeching as the heat blisters its skin. It's cornered. And it's angry."**

### 2. The Situation
This is the final Boss Fight. The environment is the weapon.

### 3. The Final Conflict
The players must use their skills to kill it or eject it.
- **Option A: The Burn (Engineer)**: *"I overload the cooling vent!"* (Roll 4+). Failure means the console explodes.
- **Option B: The Stand (Security)**: *"I use Bulwark Stance to tank the hit!"* (Read the card: You ignore the damage on a 4+ roll).
- **Option C: The Lure (Survivor)**: *"I act as bait."* Roll a d6 to dodge. If they fail, they take a Strike, but the monster is in position.
- **Option D: The Toxin (Medic)**: *"I inject the poison!"* This is an attack roll. If successful, the creature takes 2 Strikes instantly.

### 4. Resolution
- **Success**: The creature dies in a screeching finale (burned, shot, or frozen).
- **Failure**: The creature grabs a player and drags them into the vents. The others escape, but at a terrible cost.

## 🏁 Conclusion
- **Epilogue**: The ship is safe. Aris nods to the crew, acknowledging them as equals. "Not bad for a maintenance crew."
- **Loot**: The players harvest a **Xenomorph Scale** (Item) which can be crafted into armor.
