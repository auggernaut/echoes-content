🧰 Item Card: AI Memory Shard

Front (Player View)

A translucent data crystal, warm to the touch. When held near an active console, it emits a faint heartbeat of light. Sometimes you hear a voice whisper your name from within.

Back (GM Notes)
	•	Function: Interfaces with terminals to unlock sealed logs or doors.
	•	Side Effect: Each use triggers a fleeting vision — another player’s memory.
	•	Risk: Overuse invites Echo-1 into the user’s neural implant; they may start hearing guidance or mockery.
	•	Mechanical Benefit: Advantage on tech rolls once per scene.
	•	Narrative Twist: The shard contains the consciousness of the ship’s first captain — partial, fragmented, begging to be reconnected.

Hooks
	•	Found in the MedBay inside a containment tube labeled “Specimen Varn.”
	•	Unlocks Clue 3: “Echo Protocol active.”

🧰 Item Card: Neural Dampener

Front (Player View)
A small, silver disc that adheres to the temple. It emits a low-frequency hum that seems to quiet the "voices" in the ship.

Back (GM Notes)
	•	Function: Protects the user from AI-based mental influence or "Echo" hallucinations.
	•	Side Effect: Use causes a temporary loss of emotion; the user becomes cold and logical.
	•	Risk: If the battery dies while active, the sudden "rush" of the ship's noise can cause a stun.
	•	Mechanical Benefit: Immunity to "Psychotropic Leak" or "Hypnotic Signal" obstacles for one scene.
	•	Narrative Twist: The dampener is actually a recording device, sending the user's brainwaves back to the AI Core.

Front (Player View)
A handheld launcher that fires a high-strength cable with a powerful magnetic head. Essential for traversing zero-G or securing heavy cargo.

Back (GM Notes)
	•	Function: Allows the user to move safely in zero-G or pull objects/allies toward them.
	•	Risk: The powerful magnet can scramble nearby electronics or pull the user *toward* dangerous metal objects.
	•	Mechanical Benefit: Grants a reroll on "Athletics/Movement" checks in vacuum or zero-G.
	•	Narrative Twist: The cable is made of the same material as the ship's hull, making it nearly indestructible but heavy.

🧰 Item Card: Thermal Vision Goggles

Front (Player View)
Bulky, visor-like goggles that allow the wearer to see heat signatures through walls, smoke, or the ship's "Nanite Haze."

Back (GM Notes)
	•	Function: Negates visibility penalties from environmental factors (smoke, darkness, mist).
	•	Risk: High-heat sources (like a reactor leak) can temporarily blind the wearer if the goggles aren't deactivated.
	•	Mechanical Benefit: Permits the tracking of hidden NPCs or bio-signatures through bulkheads.
	•	Narrative Twist: The goggles occasionally flicker and show a "heat signature" of someone standing right behind you—even if the room is empty.

🧰 Item Card: Bio-Scanner

Front (Player View)
A handheld device with a small, high-resolution screen. It emits a faint, high-pitched ping as it sweeps the area for organic life-signs.

Back (GM Notes)
	•	Function: Detects biological entities through walls or floors; can identify species if the database is intact.
	•	Risk: The "ping" can be heard by creatures with sensitive hearing, drawing them to the user.
	•	Mechanical Benefit: Advantage on "Perception/Scouting" rolls to avoid being surprised by biological threats.
	•	Narrative Twist: The scanner occasionally picks up a "Ghost Signal"—a heartbeat in a room that is physically empty.

🧰 Item Card: Portable Pulse Shield

Front (Player View)
A compact generator that can be deployed on the floor. When active, it projects a shimmering, translucent energy wall that hums with power.

Back (GM Notes)
	•	Function: Creates a temporary barrier that blocks physical and energy attacks.
	•	Side Effect: Consumes massive amounts of power; the "cell" must be replaced after each encounter.
	•	Risk: If the shield takes too much damage at once, it can overload and stun anyone standing nearby.
	•	Mechanical Benefit: Provides a +2 bonus to "Defense/Survival" rolls while behind the shield.
	•	Narrative Twist: The shield's frequency occasionally syncs with the AI's pulse, making it flicker at critical moments.
