## The Stalker
**Tags:** [LURKER], Stealth, Vertical

**Front**
*Image: A long-limbed shadow clinging to the ceiling of a dark corridor. Its eyes are not visible, but you feel their weight.*

A flicker of movement in the peripherals. A wet, rhythmic scratching against the metal bulkheads. You feel a gaze on the back of your neck, but when you turn, there is only the humming silence of the ship. It wants you to feel alone.

## Apex Predator
**Tags:** [LURKER], Violent, Decoy

**Front**
*Image: A chitinous, shifting geometry of limbs and bone, eyes glowing with cold intelligence.*

A creature of impossible geometry—shifting limbs of chitin and bone. It doesn't growl; it mimics the sound of a ship's alarm, a perfect, chilling decoy.

*   **Boons:** +2d6 to Intimidation, +1d6 to Melee.

## Bio-Organic Hive
**Tags:** [BIO], Fixed, Persistent

**Front**
*Image: Violet veins and pulsating flesh covering a ship's corridor.*

The walls are no longer metal; they are covered in a thick, pulsating mass of violet veins and wet, leathery skin. The floor is sticky, and every step feels like you're walking on something breathing.

**Back**
*   **Strikes:** 10 (Central Core)
*   **To Hit:** 6+ (Stationary)
*   **Resistances:** Immune to piercing/bullets; Double damage from Fire.

## Rogue Sentry
**Tags:** [TECH], Mobile, Automated

**Front**
*Image: A hovering gunmetal sphere with a red laser grid scanner.*

A hovering sphere of gunmetal and glass. It tracks movement with a red laser grid. It chirps a friendly "Compliance Check" before spinning up its gatling capacitors.

*   **Strikes:** 1
*   **To Hit:** 5+
*   **Boons:** +1d6 to Perception (Scanners).
*   **Abilities:**

## Nanite Swarm
**Tags:** [TECH], [BIO], Invasive

**Front**
*Image: A glittering metallic mist vibrating against the walls.*

A metallic mist drifts through the corridor — glittering dust that hums faintly. It reacts to voices, moving toward sound. The floor beneath your boots ripples as if alive.

**Back**
*   **Strikes:** 3 (Requires Area-of-Effect or specific counter)

## Psychotropic Leak
**Tags:** [SURREAL], Abstract, Mental

**Front**
*Image: Ozone haze and detached shadows whispering on the walls.*

The air smells like ozone and burnt sugar. Shadows seem to detach from the walls. You hear your name whispered by a voice that sounds exactly like your own.

**Back**
*   **Save:** 6+
*   **Effect:** On failure, player gains the *Paranoid* condition and cannot help allies for the scene.

---

## Breached Bulkhead
**Tags:** Hazard, Environmental, Lethal

**Front**
*Image: A jagged tear in the hull showing the silent void of space.*

A jagged tear in the hull shows the silent beauty of the void. Loose objects are being sucked toward the frost-rimmed gap. The roar of escaping air is deafening.

**Back**
*   **Save:** 6+ (to avoid being pulled)
*   **Effect:** Suction pulls characters 1 zone toward the breach each turn. 0 Oxygen in the zone.

---

## Gravity Flutters
**Tags:** Disorienting, Vertical, Violent

**Front**
*Image: A room where loose tools and debris are suspended mid-air between the floor and ceiling.*

The artificial gravity is failing in waves. Your stomach lurches as the "down" becomes "up" for a heartbeat, then "sideways." The deckplates groan as the ship struggles to remember which way is home.

**Back**
*   **Trigger:** Any critical failure in a room with power issues.
*   **Effect:** [Axis Flip]: Everyone in the room must roll 4+ or be slammed into the new "floor" (ceiling or wall), taking 1 Strike (Armor allows a save). 
*   **Gameplay Twist:** For the next turn, the room's architecture is inverted. Tactical advantages (cover) are lost or repositioned.

## Automated Turrets
**Tags:** [TECH], Lethal, Fixed

**Front**
*Image: A ceiling-mounted gatling turret with a rotating barrel and a pulsing red target designator.*

A low hum precedes the metallic whir of rotating barrels. A thin, red laser beam sweeps the corridor, pausing briefly on anything that moves. A synthetic voice announces: "Bio-hazard remediation in progress. Please remain stationary for processing."

**Back**
*   **Strikes:** 2 (Fixed position)
*   **To Hit:** 3+
*   **Boons:** +1d6 to Perception (Targeting).
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Suppression Fire:** Targets must roll 5+ or lose their next move action. Players can bypass this by moving slowly or spending an **Echo** for a bypass code.

*   **Behavior:** Stationary but rotates 360 degrees. Targets the largest biological signature first.

## Rapid Flora
**Tags:** [BIO], Invasive, Explosive

**Front**
*Image: Thick, thorny vines burst through a metal bulkhead, their pods pulsing with a sickly green light.*

The ship’s metal groans as it's squeezed by a relentless tide of green. Thorny vines move with a slow, deliberate grace, wrapping around anything they touch. The air is thick with a cloying, sweet pollen that makes your lungs feel heavy.

**Back**
*   **Strikes:** 5 (Per Zone)
*   **To Hit:** 5+ (Automatic if Entangled)
*   **Resistances:** Immune to piercing; Double damage from Fire/Heat.
*   **Abilities:**

    *   **Pollen Explosion:** If hit with a physical attack, the flora releases a cloud. Roll 5+ or take a Bane on all actions for 2 turns.
*   **Behavior:** Spreads slowly. Reacts to heat and vibration.

## Boarding Party
**Tags:** Professional, Coordinated, Lethal

**Front**
*Image: A squad of three soldiers in matte-black tactical armor, moving in a tight formation with raised carbines.*

These aren't monsters; they're professionals. They move with a silent, practiced efficiency, checking corners and communicating through silent hand signals. Their armor is matte-black, absorbing the dim light of the corridor.

**Back**
*   **Strikes:** 3 (Per Squad)
*   **To Hit:** 4+
*   **Boons:** +1d6 to Tactical Positioning, +1d6 to Ranged.
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Flashbang:** Roll 4+ to dodge or become *Stunned* and *Blinded* for 1 turn.
    *   **Focus Fire:** If two or more boarders target the same PC, the PC takes a Bane on their Defense roll.
*   **Behavior:** Uses cover; retreats if the leader is killed; attempts to capture "High Value Assets."

## Hypnotic Signal
**Tags:** [SURREAL], Abstract, Mental, Persistent

**Front**
*Image: A data terminal displaying a scrolling pattern of complex geometric shapes and pulsing colors.*

The frequency isn't just a sound; it's a feeling. Your vision swims as a pattern on the monitors pulses in time with your own heartbeat. You hear a voice—not with your ears, but in the back of your mind—telling you that everything is fine, and you should just... rest.

**Back**
*   **Save:** Flip an **Echo** to **Static** or roll 5+.
*   **Effect:** On a failure, the player becomes *Dazed*. If the player has no Echoes left to flip, take a **Strike** (The Void) instead.
*   **Mechanical Twist:** Any player with a **Neural Dampener** is immune.
*   **Narrative Insight:** The signal is a corrupted version of a deep-sleep cycle designed to keep passengers calm during long transits.
