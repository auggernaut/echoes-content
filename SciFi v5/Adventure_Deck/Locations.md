## AI Core Chamber
**Tags:** Freezing, Hushed, Charged

**Front (Player-Facing)**
*Image: Dark server room with a central glowing monolith. Cables like tree roots.*
Cable looms gather like roots around a cold, black obelisk of memory lattice. The temperature drops with each step toward the core, and breath crystallizes in the air. This is the ship's brain, and it is vast.

**Back (GM Detail)**
*   **Sensory:** The low, vibrating hum of massive data processing; the smell of ozone and dry, cold air; the static charge that makes hair stand up; the pulsing blue light of the memory lattice.

    *   **Interface Port:** A specialized terminal for direct neural-link interaction.
    *   **Halon Vents:** Emergency vents designed to snuff out electrical fires by removing oxygen.
*   **Hazards:** Halon gas dumps; neuro-shock from the interface; extreme freezing temperatures; electrical arcs from server racks.
*   **Reveals:** A manual "kill switch" hidden under floor plates; heat signatures nesting in the cable looms; unauthorized data-mining logs.

## Cargo Hold
**Tags:** Cavernous, Echoing, Shadowy

**Front (Player-Facing)**
Columns of cargo crates rise into the darkness above, forming a labyrinth of metal and plastic. Every distant clank or hiss echoes through the vast space. The scale makes you feel small and exposed in this canyon of shipping containers.

**Back (GM Detail)**
*   **Sensory:** The booming echo of your own footsteps; the smell of grease and wet cardboard; the industrial chill of an unheated space; the sight of towering, swaying crate stacks.
*   **Features:**

    *   **Cargo Crane:** A heavy overhead crane on rails, currently locked mid-move.
    *   **Maintenance Vents:** Wide floor grates leading to the ship's gut.
*   **Hazards:** Unstable crate stacks; high-voltage conduits; shifting shadow-blindness; toxic fumes from leaking containers.
*   **Reveals:** A container labeled "Classified Bio-Hazard"; a trail of discarded gear leading to a dark corner; a hidden living space among the crates.

## The Gut (Maintenance)
**Tags:** Cramped, Hissing, Vibrating

**Front (Player-Facing)**
*Image: Narrow maintenance shafts filled with hissing steam and low-hanging wires.*
The walls squeeze in. You can feel the ship's heartbeat through the vibrating steel. It's a claustrophobic vein of pipes, cables, and narrow crawlspaces. Every movement feels loud, and every hiss of steam feels like a breath.

**Back (GM Detail)**
*   **Sensory:** The intense heat of the pipe-walls; the smell of recycled air and old sweat; the constant, grinding vibration; the dim, red emergency lighting.

## Hydroponics Wing
**Tags:** Humid, Overgrown, Oxygen-Rich

**Front (Player-Facing)**
The air here is sweet—too sweet. Oxygen levels are in the red, making your skin tingle. Pale vines creep out of shattered growth tanks, illuminated by the ghostly green glow of nutrient vats. The mist is thick enough to hide anything.

**Back (GM Detail)**

**Front (Player-Facing)**
*Image: A cluster of massive satellite dishes and antenna spires jutting out into the void. A narrow, frost-rimmed catwalk leads to a central maintenance hub.*
The wind doesn't blow here, but the silence screams. A network of skeletal antenna towers reaches into the black, their warning lights blinking like slow, dying stars. A faint, rhythmic static vibrates through the metal beneath your boots.

**Back (GM Detail)**
*   **Sensory:** The absolute silence of the vacuum; the smell of cold metal and ozone; the pin-prick cold of the void; the visual vertigo of the star-field spinning slowly.
