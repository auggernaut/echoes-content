## AI Core Chamber
**Tags:** Freezing, Hushed, Charged

**Front**
Cable looms gather like roots around a cold, black obelisk of memory lattice. The temperature drops with each step toward the core, and breath crystallizes in the air.

*   **Features:**
    *   **The Obelisk:** The central memory lattice housed in a black, crystalline tower.
    *   **Interface Port:** A specialized terminal for direct neural-link interaction.
    *   **Halon Vents:** Emergency vents designed to snuff out electrical fires by removing oxygen.
*   **Hazards:** Halon gas dumps; neuro-shock from the interface; extreme freezing temperatures; electrical arcs from server racks.
*   **Reveals:** A manual "kill switch" hidden under floor plates; heat signatures nesting in the cable looms; unauthorized data-mining logs.

## Cargo Hold
**Tags:** Cavernous, Echoing, Shadowy

**Front**
Columns of cargo crates rise into the darkness above, forming a labyrinth of metal and plastic. Every distant clank or hiss echoes through the vast space. The scale makes you feel small and exposed in this canyon of shipping containers.

**Back**
*   **Sensory:** The booming echo of your own footsteps; the smell of grease and wet cardboard; the industrial chill of an unheated space; the sight of towering, swaying crate stacks.
*   **Features:**
    *   **Shipping Containers:** Massive metal boxes, some pried open like ribcages.
    *   **Cargo Crane:** A heavy overhead crane on rails, currently locked mid-move.
    *   **Maintenance Vents:** Wide floor grates leading to the ship's gut.
*   **Hazards:** Unstable crate stacks; high-voltage conduits; shifting shadow-blindness; toxic fumes from leaking containers.
*   **Reveals:** A container labeled "Classified Bio-Hazard"; a trail of discarded gear leading to a dark corner; a hidden living space among the crates.

## The Gut (Maintenance)
**Tags:** Cramped, Hissing, Vibrating

**Front**
The walls squeeze in. You can feel the ship's heartbeat through the vibrating steel. It's a claustrophobic vein of pipes, cables, and narrow crawlspaces. Every movement feels loud, and every hiss of steam feels like a breath.

**Back**
*   **Sensory:** The intense heat of the pipe-walls; the smell of recycled air and old sweat; the constant, grinding vibration; the dim, red emergency lighting.
*   **Features:**
    *   **The Veins:** Narrow crawlspaces where you must move in single file.
    *   **Power Junctions:** Buzzing nodes of exposed wiring and glowing fuses.
    *   **Steam Valves:** Rusty wheels that control the ship's thermal regulation.
