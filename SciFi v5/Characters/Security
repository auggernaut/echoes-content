🎴 Security Deck (10 Cards)

⸻

✅ With this:
	•	Defense (pick 1) → how you survive (includes Health)
	•	Boon (pick 1) → how you excel
	•	Deck Draws (2–3 cards) → abilities, gear, special moves

So a Security officer could be:
	•	Combat Armor + Trained Marksman → classic marine.
	•	Reactive Dodge + Tactical Instincts → fast strategist.
	•	Bulwark Stance + Chain of Command → shield wall leader.
