# The Silent Mutiny
**Tags:** Intrigue, Thriller, Human-Conflict

## **Summary (GM Only)**
**Lt. Senn** has initiated a security coup, claiming the crew is unfit for the mission. He has locked down the ship using **Rogue Sentries** and is purging "disloyal" memory logs from the Core.

## **Hook (Read Aloud)**
*"Without warning, the deck vibrates with a deep, floor-shaking thud. The standard white illumination shifts to a flickering, high-alert red, but no sirens follow. One by one, the bulkheads start to hiss shut, sealing the ship into a series of isolated boxes. The comms are open, but they carry only the sound of rhythmic, synchronized breathing—followed by a voice you recognize, issuing a command for a security code that hasn't been used in years."*

## **Hook Questions**
1. *What did Senn do during the last inspection that made you realize he was breaking?*
2. *Which of the **Rogue Sentries** (Threat) bears a serial number you recognize?*
3. *What 'Black Box' data are you hiding that Senn would kill to delete?*

## **Locations**
*   **The Bridge**: Protected by **Automated security defenses** (Hazard). The **Captain's Chair** (Feature) is the only place to upload a **Social** or **Tech** override.
*   **AI Core Chamber**: **Neuro-shock** (Hazard) triggers if you try to stop the purge. A **Manual Kill Switch** (Reveal) is hidden under the floor, but reaching it requires stealth.
*   **Observation Deck**: **Gravity flutters** (Hazard) make this a difficult zone for combat. **Senn** has left a **Discarded Data-pad** (Reveal) here detailing his true motives.

## **NPCs**
*   **Lt. Senn**: Currently on the **Bridge**. He uses **Tactical Command** to coordinate the **Rogue Sentries** (Threat). He holds the **Bridge Key** (Loot).
*   **Maintenance Unit 17**: A rogue droid found in **The Gut**. It has been reprogrammed by the PCs (or Senn) and acts as a wild-card ally with **Heavy Welding** capabilities.

## **Threats**
*   **Rogue Sentry**: Move them in strict patrol loops. Use the **Compliance Check** (flash-strobe) as an opening move to stun players before they can react. If a Sentry isn't destroyed immediately, narrate it pinging the network to **Call for Backup**, effectively doubling the threat count each turn.

## **Endings**
*   **The Restoration**: Senn is neutralized and the **AI Memory Shard** (Loot) is returned to the Core, restoring the original personality of the ship's AI.
*   **The Exile**: The PCs seize a shuttle, leaving the ship under Senn's control. They are free, but the "Corporate Bounty" on their heads has just gone active.
