# 🎴 How to Play: Story Guide
## *Learning through Action*

Welcome to **SciFi v5**. This guide is designed to teach you the rules of the game while simultaneously walking you through the first scene of a scenario. Whether you are the GM (Game Master) or a Player, follow this guide to understand how the card system drives immersion and tension.

---

## 🛠 Step 1: Setup
*Before the story begins, prepare the physical table.*

1.  **Select a Scenario**: Open a scenario file (e.g., `The Stalkers Shadow`).
2.  **Prepare the Decks**: Separate your cards into five decks:
    *   **Locations** (Environment)
    *   **NPCs** (People)
    *   **Threats** (Danger)
    *   **Loot** (Items)
    *   **Character Decks** (Player roles like Engineer, Medic, etc.)
3.  **Create your Loadout**: Each player chooses a **Character Deck**. They reveal their identity and select their starting **[DEFENSE]**, **[BOON]**, and 3 other cards (**[ITEM]** or **[ABILITY]**) to fill their 5-slot loadout.

## 🎲 The Walkthrough: "The Stalker's Shadow"

### **Objective: The Hook**
The GM reads the **Hook** from the scenario. 

> **GM**: *"The emergency lighting flickers, then dies. Something has moved the cargo in the corridor ahead—not with a crash, but with a slow, grinding deliberate weight."*

### **Rule 1: Hook Questions (Character Grounding)**
Instead of rolling dice, the GM asks a **Hook Question** to establish the character's stakes.
*   **GM to Player**: *"Who in your past was taken by a shadow, and why does this sound exactly like that?"*
*   **Success**: The player answers. This establishes their motivation without a single rule needed.

### 🌟 Rule: Roleplay Rewards
Tell the players: *"If you do something cool, act in character, or make a choice that makes the story better (even if it hurts your character), I will give you a **Karma Token** (Hero Die). You can use these to re-roll dice later."*

### **Rule 2: Scene Setting (GM Only)**
The GM draws a **Location Card** (e.g., **Cargo Hold**). **Important**: Players never see the back of this card.
*   **The GM's Role**: Describe the **Sensory** atmosphere (the hiss of pipes, the smell of ozone). Use the **Features** list to pepper your description with interesting objects (like "massive shipping containers").
*   **The Players' Role**: They listen and declare actions. "I want to hide behind those *Shipping Containers*."
*   **The Reaction**: The GM checks the card's **Hazards** or **Reveals**. "As you duck behind the crate, you feel a **vibration** (Hazard) under your boots—the magnetic locks are failing."

### **Rule 3: Resolving Conflict (The DR)**
The Player wants to use their **Bio-Scanner** to find the source of the noise.
1.  **Intent**: The player announces their action: "I'm using my Bio-Scanner to sweep the crates for heat signatures."
2.  **The GM Sets the DR (Difficulty Rating)**: Only now does the GM set the target number. "This is a dark, cluttered room. You need a **5+** to find a clear signal."
3.  **Check the Cards**: The player looks at their equipped cards. "I have a **Bio-Scanner** [ITEM]. Its text says: *'Boon on any [Perception] or [Tech] roll to find life.'*" 
    *   **Note on Tags**: You might see tags like **[Tech]** or **[Engineering]**. These don't give Boons themselves; they are used for syngery with other cards or specific GM rewards.
4.  **The Roll**: If the player has a **Boon**, they roll **2d6** and take the highest number. If they have a **Bane**, they roll **2d6** and take the lowest. Otherwise, they roll a single **1d6**.
5.  **The Result**: If they hit the DR, they succeed. If not, the GM narrates a **Consequence**.

### **Rule 4: Threats & Strikes**
The GM reveals a **Threat Card**: **The Stalker**.
*   **Combat**: The Stalker strikes from the shadows.
*   **Damage**: This game uses **Strikes**, not hit points. Characters can usually take 2-3 Strikes before they are "Broken."
*   **Counter-Play**: The player can spend a **Boon** from a card feature (like a [Blast Shutter]) to negate a Strike.

### **Rule 5: Awarding Karma**
**Karma** is the fuel of the game. The GM awards Karma when a player:
*   Makes a tactical sacrifice.
*   Roleplays a flaw that makes the situation worse.
*   Describes a "Reveal" in a way that wows the table.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Karma Usage**: Players can spend 1 Karma to automatically succeed at a DR check or to ignore a Strike.

## 🏁 Finalizing the Session
Once the scenario reaches an **Ending**, the GM leads a brief debrief.
*   *What was the most terrifying moment?*
*   *Who earned the most Karma?*
*   *What did we learn about the ship's secret?*

Now that you know the flow, choose your next scenario and begin your adventure.
