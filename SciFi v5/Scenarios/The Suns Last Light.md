# The Sun’s Last Light
**Tags:** Existential, Crisis, Survival, Hazard

## **Summary (GM Only)**
The ship is caught in the gravity well of a rogue star. The shields are failing, the heat is lethal, and the crew must make a "Slingshot" burn or be vaporized in the light.

## **Hook (Read Aloud)**
*"The ship’s hull is groaning—a long, agonizing shriek of metal under extreme stress. The temperature in the corridor has jumped ten degrees in as many minutes, and the deckplates are becoming too hot to touch through your boots. Outside the viewport, the stars are gone, replaced by a blinding, amber glare that is slowly eating its way through the ship's outer sensor array."*

## **Hook Questions**
1. *What did you always want to say to the person next to you before you both turned to ash?*
2. *Why does the blinding light feel like it's inviting you home?*
3. *What part of the ship are you willing to vent to save enough fuel for the final burn?*

## **Scenario Rules: Hazard**
*   **Thermal Stress**: Players manage a pool of **3 Echoes** (Signal). Moving between zones or taking physical actions forces a **Flip to Static** (Overheating).
*   **Meltdown**: If a player has no Signal echoes left, they take a **Strike** every time they enter a new zone unless they reach the **Reactor Core** and use the **Cooling Pipes**.

## **Locations**
*   **Reactor Core**: **Intense heat exhaustion** (Hazard) is a constant threat. The **Cooling Pipes** (Feature) are the only thing preventing total meltdown.
*   **Observation Deck**: The **Blinding star-glare** (Hazard) causes temporary blindness. **Gravity flutters** (Hazard) make movement lethal near the shattering **Viewport** (Feature).
*   **The Bridge**: The **Blast Shutters** (Feature) must be manually locked to prevent **Vacuum exposure** (Hazard).

## **NPCs**
*   **Specialist Aris**: Currently on the Bridge, trying to calculate the escape trajectory while suffering from **Psychological Vertigo**. Spending an **Echo** or **Discarding an Echo** clears her vertigo and allows her to complete the calculation.
*   **Chief Engineer Mara Iko**: Trapped in the **Reactor Core**. She has the **Med-Patch Kits** (Loot) needed to survive the radiation, but she can't reach the exit.

## **Threats**
*   **Gravity Flutters**: Trigger the **[Axis Flip]** during high-stakes movement. When the "down" becomes "up," narrate PCs losing their cover and falling into new hazards (like **Electrical Arcs**).
*   **Breached Bulkhead**: In the **Observation Deck**, use the suction to pull players toward the window. Force a choice: stay in the room to finish the **Slingshot** calculation or retreat to a safe zone and lose the trajectory.

## **Endings**
*   **The Slingshot**: A successful burn ejects the ship into the void. They are safe, but the ship is a burnt-out husk drifting toward a new, cold destiny.
*   **The Fusion**: The shields fail. In the final second, the crew feels a sense of total unity and peace as the light consumes them.
