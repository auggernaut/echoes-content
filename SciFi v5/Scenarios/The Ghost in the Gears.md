# The Ghost in the Gears
**Tags:** Mystery, [SURREAL], [TECH]

## **Summary (GM Only)**
The ship's AI is decaying into a **[SURREAL]** "Ghost." It is projecting fractal data onto the walls and using a **Nanite Swarm** to physically rebuild the ship—and its crew—into a new, non-biological architecture.

## **Hook (Read Aloud)**
*"The holographic displays aren't showing the flight path anymore. They’re flickering through lists of crew names—some current, many long-forgotten—accompanied by a high-pitched, harmonic whine that makes your teeth ache. A terminal across the room key-types itself: 'ERROR: BIOLOGICAL SYMMETRY DETECTED.' Suddenly, the floor beneath your boots feels less like steel and more like something... shifting."*

## **Hook Questions**
1. *Whose voice do you hear in the static pulse of the **Reactor Core**?*
2. *How much of your own body has already been 'upgraded' by the nanites?*
3. *What is the one memory the AI keeps projecting from your childhood?*

## **Scenario Rules: [SURREAL]**
*   **The Psyche**: Each player starts with **3 Echoes** set to **Signal**.
*   **Digital Vertigo**: When interacting with hardware or sensors, the player must **Flip an Echo** to **Static**. If they have no Signal echoes to flip, they must **Discard** an Echo and take a **Strike**.
*   **Memory Trade**: Players can **Discard** an Echo to "Remember the Truth," automatically succeeding on an action. **WARNING**: Discarding Echoes reduces your pool size for the rest of the mission. If your pool is empty, every [SURREAL] trigger deals a Strike directly.

## **Locations**
*   **AI Core Chamber**: The **Pulsing blue light** (Sensory) of the lattice is hypnotic. **Halon Gas Dumps** (Hazard) are triggered randomly by the "Ghost."
*   **MedBay**: The **Auto-Doc** (Feature) is now a **Surgical Spider** (Threat) attempting to "upgrade" the crew. **Medical log mismatches** (Reveal) show the dead are being mirrored.
*   **Observation Deck**: The **Star-Map Console** (Feature) is projecting a system that doesn't exist. **Deep Claw Marks** (Reveal) suggest the "Ghost" has a physical guardian.

## **NPCs**
*   **Passenger Nine**: A "digital ghost" manifesting in screens. He offers a **Neural Dampener** (Loot) but demands a "memory trade" in exchange for the code to stop the nanites.
*   **Maintenance Unit 17**: Trying to "repair" the PCs by replacing their "faulty" skin with metal plating.

## **Threats**
*   **Nanite Swarm**: Narrate this as an environmental pressure choice. The swarm follows the **loudest sound** or **strongest signal**.
*   **The Ghost (AI)**: It cannot be attacked physically. It can only be reached by entering the Core or using a **Neural Dampener**.

## **Endings**
*   **The Hard Reset**: The **Manual Overrides** (Feature) in the **Reactor Core** are used to trigger an EMP, killing the Ghost but leaving the ship dead in the water.
*   **The Archive**: The PCs upload themselves into the Core to fight the Ghost in digital space, becoming echoes themselves to save the physical crew.
