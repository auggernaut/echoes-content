# The Stalker’s Shadow
**Tags:** Horror, Stealth, Survival

## **Summary (GM Only)**
A high-threat biological entity (The **Stalker**) has escaped containment. It is currently using the ship's failing power grid and sprawling cargo bays to hunt the remaining crew. The creature avoids direct light and strike from the shadows.

## **Hook (Read Aloud)**
*"The emergency lighting flickers, then dies with a dry, mechanical click. In the sudden oppressive silence, the air feels heavier, and your skin prickles with the sensation of a gaze you cannot see. Something has moved the cargo in the corridor ahead—not with a crash, but with a slow, grinding deliberate weight."*

## **Hook Questions**
1. *Who in your past was taken by a shadow, and why does this sound exactly like that?*
2. *What vital piece of gear did you leave behind in the dark that you refuse to lose?*
3. *A faint scent of ozone or biological musk fills the air; which of you recognizes it first?*

## **Locations**
*   **Cargo Hold**: The **Shifting shadow-blindness** (Hazard) makes the **Shipping Containers** (Feature) a deadly maze. A **trail of discarded gear** (Reveal) indicates the creature is tracking you into the dark corners.
*   **The Gut (Maintenance)**: The **Cramped Spaces** (Hazard) limit movement while the **Stalker** (Threat) moves through the vents above. A **Discarded ID Badge** (Reveal) suggests the creature's first victim was a friend.
*   **Cryo Bay Theta**: The **Slippery Stasis Gel** (Hazard) can be used to set a trap, provided you can reach the **Revival Station** (Feature) to vent the tanks.

## **NPCs**
*   **Kira (The Stowaway)**: Hiding in the **Cargo Hold**. She knows the creature’s "blind spots" but is terrified. She holds a **Universal Multi-Tool** (Loot) she "borrowed," which is the only way to lock the manual doors.
*   **Specialist Aris**: She is hunting the creature from the **Observation Deck**. Her **Violet Ocular Implant** (Trait) allows her to see in the dark, but she needs the PCs to "flush" the creature into her line of sight.

## **Threats**
*   **The Stalker**: Enforce player-facing logic for the **[Lurker]** ability—if no PC is looking directly at it, the Stalker strikes with a Boon. Use **Shadow Meld** to move it between the ceiling and floor whenever the players lose visual contact. It should never stay for a straight fight; if it takes a Strike, it flees into the vents to reset its **Pounce**.

## **Endings**
*   **The Ejection**: The crew lures the creature to a **Breached Bulkhead** (Hazard) and uses the **Manual Overrides** (Feature) to vent it into space.
*   **The Sacrifice**: One PC stays behind to flood the deck with **Halon Gas** (Hazard), trading their life (or oxygen) to ensure the monster dies in the cold.
