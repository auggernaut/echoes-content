# The Stalker’s Shadow
**Tags:** Horror, Stealth, [LURKER]

## **Summary (GM Only)**
A high-threat biological entity (The **Stalker**) has escaped containment. It is currently using the ship's failing power grid and sprawling cargo bays to hunt the remaining crew. As a **[LURKER]**, it avoids direct light and strikes from the shadows.

## **Hook (Read Aloud)**
*"The emergency lighting flickers, then dies with a dry, mechanical click. In the sudden oppressive silence, the air feels heavier, and your skin prickles with the sensation of a gaze you cannot see. Something has moved the cargo in the corridor ahead—not with a crash, but with a slow, grinding deliberate weight."*

## **Hook Questions**
1. *Who in your past was taken by a shadow, and why does this sound exactly like that?*
2. *What vital piece of gear did you leave behind in the dark that you refuse to lose?*
3. *A faint scent of ozone or biological musk fills the air; which of you recognizes it first?*

## **Scenario Rules: [LURKER]**
*   **The Gaze**: If no player explicitly describes their character watching the ceiling or vents, the Stalker is considered "Hidden." It gains a **Boon** on its next attack, and the target must **Flip an Echo** to **Static** (Paranoia/Surprised).
*   **Flare**: Players can **Discard** an Echo or an **[ITEM]** use to "Light the Way," removing the Stalker's Hidden status for the rest of the scene.

## **Locations**
*   **Cargo Hold**: The **Shifting shadow-blindness** (Hazard) makes the **Shipping Containers** (Feature) a deadly maze. A **trail of discarded gear** (Reveal) indicates the creature is tracking you into the dark corners.
*   **The Gut (Maintenance)**: The **Cramped Spaces** (Hazard) limit movement while the **Stalker** moves through the vents above. A **Discarded ID Badge** (Reveal) suggests the creature's first victim was a friend.
*   **Cryo Bay Theta**: The **Slippery Stasis Gel** (Hazard) can be used to set a trap, provided you can reach the **Revival Station** (Feature) to vent the tanks.

## **NPCs**
*   **Kira (The Stowaway)**: Hiding in the **Cargo Hold**. She knows the creature’s "blind spots" but is terrified. She holds a **Universal Multi-Tool** (Loot) she "borrowed," which is the only way to lock the manual doors.
*   **Specialist Aris**: She is hunting the creature from the **Observation Deck**. Her **Violet Ocular Implant** (Trait) allows her to see in the dark, but she needs the PCs to "flush" the creature into her line of sight.

## **Threats**
*   **The Stalker**: 
    *   **Pounce**: Attacks from the Hidden state deal +1 Strike.
    *   **Shadow Meld**: If it takes a Strike, it immediately flees into the vents to reset its position.

## **Endings**
*   **The Ejection**: The crew lures the creature to a **Breached Bulkhead** (Hazard) and uses the **Manual Overrides** (Feature) to vent it into space.
*   **The Sacrifice**: One PC stays behind to flood the deck with **Halon Gas** (Hazard), trading their life (or oxygen) to ensure the monster dies in the cold.
