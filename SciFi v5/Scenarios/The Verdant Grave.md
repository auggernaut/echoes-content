**Tags:** [BIO], Invasive, Resource Management, Jungle

## **Summary (GM Only)**
A **[BIO]** mutation in the **Hydroponics Wing** has turned the ship's life support into a carnivorous jungle. The **Apex Predator** has integrated itself into the plumbing, and the oxygen is becoming toxic.

## **Hook (Read Aloud)**
*"The recycled air has changed. It’s sweet, humid, and carries a scent of wet decay that shouldn't exist in a machine of metal and glass. A low-priority alert is pulsing on a nearby terminal: 'Oxygen Production: Critical Over-Capacity.' Somewhere deep in the ship, a distress beacon has started to chime, but its signal is muffled, as if being broadcast through a wall of wet wool."*

## **Hook Questions**
1. *Why does the smell of wet earth make you feel more sick than relieved?*
2. *What did you promise **Dr. Kael Varn** before he went missing in the overgrowth?*
3. *You see a flower blooming from a metal vent; why does its color remind you of home?*

## **Scenario Rules: [BIO]**
*   **Infection**: Any time a player interacts with the overgrowth without protection or fails a dodge against a spore-threat, they must **Flip an Echo** to **Static** (Infected).
*   **Slow Burn**: If a player ends a scene with one or more Static echoes, they take a **Strike** as the infection spreads.
*   **Anti-Spore**: Players can **Discard** an Echo or an **[ITEM]** use to clear all infections in their zone.

## **Locations**
*   **Hydroponics Wing**: The **Flammable Atmosphere** (Hazard) makes using weapons a suicidal risk. The **Oxygen Scrubbers** (Feature) are the source of the spores.
*   **MedBay**: **Toxic chemical spills** (Hazard) have combined with the mutation. Use the **Auto-Doc** (Feature) to synthesize a herbicide... if you can stop it from trying to "harvest" you first.
*   **The Gut (Maintenance)**: **Scalding steam bursts** (Hazard) occur where vines have crushed the pipes. A **Makeshift Nest** (Reveal) shows the predator is evolving.

## **NPCs**
*   **Dr. Kael Varn**: Found in the **MedBay**, partially merged with the **Bio-Organic Hive** (Threat). He insists the plants are the ship’s "new immune system" and begs you not to kill them.
*   **Chief Engineer Mara Iko**: She is in the **Reactor Core**, preparing a **Thermal Siphon** (Loot) to "burn out" the infection. She is traumatized and requires an **Echo** to be spent to trust the PCs again.

## **Threats**
*   **Bio-Organic Hive**: Treat this as environmental hazard first. Use the **Entangle** ability (roll 4+ or be Restrained) whenever players stop moving. Narrate the walls "tightening" around them.
*   **Apex Predator**: Use its **Terrifying Mimic** ability to project the voices of trapped crew members from the **Hydroponics Wing**. If players are Paralyzed by fear, have the Predator focus its **Multi-Strike** on the most armored PC to "prove dominance."

## **Endings**
*   **The Scorch**: The **Thermal Siphon** (Loot) is used to flash-freeze or incinerate the growth, saving the ship but destroying the food supply.
*   **The Hybrid**: Dr. Varn's research is used to "stabilize" the growth. The ship lives, but it now requires organic "nutrients" every cycle to generate oxygen.
