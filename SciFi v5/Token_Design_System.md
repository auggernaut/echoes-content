# 🪙 Token Design System: Echoes

Echoes are the universal resource in SciFi v5, representing a character's mental focus, luck, and narrative stability. They replace all previous "Karma" and "Condition" systems with a single, tactile pool of dual-sided tokens.

## Physical Component
*   **Dual-Sided Tokens**: A set of tokens with two distinct faces.
*   **⚪ Side A: Signal (White)**: Represents clarity, resolve, and stability.
*   **⚫ Side B: Static (Black)**: Represents distortion, trauma, and corruption.

## The Economy of Echoes

| Verb | Mechanical Action | Narrative Meaning |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Gain** | Add a **Signal** token to your pool. | Finding hope, roleplaying your past, or catching a break. |
| **Spend** | Discard a **Signal** token. | Exerting effort, luck, or "Remembering the Truth." |
| **Flip** | Turn a **Signal** token to its **Static** side. | Sustaining psychological pressure or technical glitches. |
| **Restore** | Turn a **Static** token back to its **Signal** side. | Finding a "Safe Zone" or using medical/psych tools. |
| **Discard** | Permanently remove a token (any side) from your pool. | A permanent loss of self or resources for the mission. |

## Pool Capacity
*   **Starting Pool**: Players begin each mission with **3 Echoes** (Signal).
*   **No Cap**: There is no hard limit on how many Echoes you can hold. You are encouraged to gain them through roleplay and heroism. 
*   **The Hunger**: However, there is also no "safety net." The more you have, the more you have to lose. Scenarios are designed to drain this pool relentlessly—**The Void is always hungry.**

## The Void (The Zero-State)
If a player has **0 Echoes** in their pool (all discarded or lost), they are in a state of total exposure. 
*   Every trigger that would force a **Flip** or **Discard** deals a **Strike** instead.
*   Narratively, the character has lost their connection to reality, the ship, or their team.

## Designer Note: Re-Skinning Static
While the core term is **Static**, GMs and Scenario writers should flavor the "Black" side based on the horror archetype:
*   [LURKER]: Paranoia / Sensory Noise
*   [SURREAL]: Memory Loss / Geometric Vertigo
*   [BIO]: Infection / Neural Decay
*   [TECH]: Lockout / System Glitch
