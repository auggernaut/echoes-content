# 🎴 Facilitator Guide: Waking Local
## *A GM’s First-Session Script*

This guide is designed for the **Game Master (GM)** to read aloud and follow at the table. By following these steps, you will teach your players the rules while simultaneously playing through the first scene of **The Stalker's Shadow**.

---

## 🛠 Step 1: Physical Setup
**GM Action**: *Set the physical components of the game. Do not start the story yet.*

1.  **Select Scenario**: Choose a scenario to play. For this walkthrough, we are using **The Stalker's Shadow**.
2.  **Filter the Adventure Deck**: The Adventure Deck contains four card types: **Locations**, **NPCs**, **Threats**, and **Loot**. For this specific adventure, find the following cards and put the rest aside—they won't be needed for this session:
    *   **Locations**: Cargo Hold, The Gut (Maintenance), Cryo Bay Theta.
    *   **NPCs**: Kira (The Stowaway), Specialist Aris.
    *   **Threats**: The Stalker.
    *   **Loot**: Bio-Scanner, Universal Multi-Tool.

## 🛠 Step 2: Introduction
**Read Aloud**: 
> *"Welcome to the ship. We are playing **SciFi v5**, a game of horror and hard choices. You are the crew of a deep-space vessel. Something has gone wrong, and your survival depends on the gear you carry and the choices you make. There are no safe corners here."*

---

## 🛠 Step 3: Character Discovery
**Read Aloud**:
> *"Each of you, choose a **Character Deck**. This is your role on the ship. Once you have it, flip the top card to reveal who you are."*

**GM Action**: *As they reveal their identities, explain the **5-Slot Loadout**.*

**Read Aloud**:
> *"Look at your deck. You have a **5-slot loadout**. To build your starting hand, pick **one [DEFENSE]** card, **one [BOON]** card, and any **3 other cards** ([ITEM] or [ABILITY]) for a total of 5. These are the tools you woke up with."*

---

## 🛠 Step 4: The Hook
**GM Action**: *Read the Hook from the scenario guide. Use it to set the mood.*

**Read Aloud**:
> *"The emergency lighting flickers, then dies with a dry, mechanical click. In the sudden oppressive silence, the air feels heavier. Something has moved the cargo in the corridor ahead—not with a crash, but with a slow, grinding deliberate weight."*

**GM Action**: *Establish character stakes immediately using **Hook Questions**.*

**Read Aloud to a Player**: 
> *"Who in your past was taken by a shadow, and why does this sound exactly like that?"*

---

## 🛠 Step 5: Scene Setting
**GM Action**: *Draw the **Cargo Hold** Location card. Keep the back hidden from players.*

**Read Aloud**:
> *"We are in the **Cargo Hold**. Massive shipping containers rise into the darkness like metal cliffs. The air smells of wet metal and old cardboard. You can hear a rhythmic scratching coming from somewhere above."*

**GM Action**: *Explain how players interact with the environment.*

**Read Aloud**: 
> *"I will describe the world. You tell me what you want to do. If you want to use a **Feature** I mentioned—like hiding behind a container—just tell me. If do something cool or act in character, I'll give you a **Karma Token** which you can use for re-rolls later."*

---

## 🛠 Step 6: The First Action (Resolving Conflict)
**Read Aloud to the Table**:
> *"You hear that scratching again. It's closer. Someone needs to find out where it's coming from. **What do you do?**"*

**GM Action**: *Wait for a player to suggest an action (e.g., "I'll use my Bio-Scanner").*

1.  **Set the Difficulty (DR)**: *"Because it's dark and cluttered, this is a **DR 5+** check."*
2.  **Check for Boons**: *"Check your cards. Does any item or ability give you a **Boon** for this?"* (e.g., Bio-Scanner).
3.  **The Roll**:
    *   **Boon**: Roll **2d6**, take the **highest**.
    *   **Bane**: Roll **2d6**, take the **lowest**.
    *   **Standard**: Roll **1d6**.
4.  **Narrate the Consequence**: If they fail, don't just say 'nothing happens.' Say: *"The scanner glitches—you don't see the threat, but it definitely sees you. Something drops from the ceiling."*

---

## 🛠 Step 7: Conflict & Damage
**GM Action**: *Reveal **The Stalker** Threat card.*

**Read Aloud**:
> *"A long-limbed shadow clings to the ceiling, its eyes glowing with a cold light. It strikes!"*

**Explain Damage**:
> *"In this game, you don't have health points. You take **Strikes**. Most of you can only take 3 before you are 'Broken.' You can spend a **Karma Token** or a feature from one of your **[DEFENSE]** cards to negate a Strike. If you can't, mark a Strike on your sheet."*

---

## 🏁 Step 8: Play On
**Read Aloud**:
> *"The rules are in your hands now. I will continue to weave the scenario, and you will continue to survive. Let's see who makes it to the endgame."*
