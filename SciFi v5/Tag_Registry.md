# 🏷️ Tag Registry (Designer Guide)

**INTERNAL DESIGN DOCUMENT**: Use this registry to ensure thematic consistency across different archetypes. 

### 🪙 The Universal Resource: Echoes
SciFi v5 uses a single pool of dual-sided tokens—**Echoes**—to track all non-physical pressure.
*   **⚪ Signal (Side A)**: Clarity, Resolve, and Luck.
*   **⚫ Static (Side B)**: Distortion, Trauma, and Glitches.
*   **The Void**: When a player has **0 Echoes**, all resource-based triggers (Flip/Discard) deal a **Strike** directly.

## 🌌 Primary Archetypes

### 🌑 [LURKER]
*   **Narrative**: Predators that strike from the blind spots of perception. They are the scratch in the vent, the flickering light, and the feeling of being watched.
*   **Themes**: Isolation, Paranoia, Vulnerability.
*   **Suggested Mechanics**: Line-of-sight triggers, ambush boons, environmental hiding.

### 🌀 [SURREAL]
*   **Narrative**: Threats that warp memory, logic, and the laws of physics. They represent the ship itself becoming an unreliable narrator.
*   **Themes**: Identity Loss, Impossible Geometry, Psychological Decay.
*   **Suggested Mechanics**: Echo flips/discards, "Psyche" pools, narrative hallucinations.

### 🌿 [BIO]
*   **Narrative**: Invasive, wet, and evolutionary horror. Rapid growth, mutation, and the subversion of the biological form.
*   **Themes**: Contagion, Mutation, Visceral Decay.
*   **Suggested Mechanics**: Slow Burn infections, spreading hazards, specialized gear requirements.

### ⚡ [TECH]
*   **Narrative**: Rogue AIs, automated security, and cold, calculating mechanical logic. The ship's original systems turning against the crew.
*   **Themes**: Clinical Violence, Surveillance, Obsolescence.
*   **Suggested Mechanics**: Rigid Protocols, equipment locks, technical bypasses.

## 🛡️ Secondary Traits

| Tag | Narrative Meaning | Suggested Themes/Mechanics |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Lethal** | High capacity for direct physical strikes. | Low "To Hit" numbers, multi-strikes. |
| **Fixed** | Stationary or bound to a specific location. | Environmental interaction, bypass potential. |
| **Invasive** | Spreads quickly and takes up space. | Zone-wide effects, persistent growth. |
| **Explosive** | Volatile and reactive to external stimuli. | Area-of-Effect strikes, chain reactions. |
| **Professional** | Coordinated, trained, and tactical. | Boons for positioning, squad-based morale. |
| **Coordinated** | Works in tandem with others. | Pack tactics, focusing fire on single targets. |
| **Abstract** | Non-physical or conceptual threats. | Mental conditions, sensory distortion. |
| **Mental** | Targets the consciousness directly. | Save-based effects, dazed/paranoid conditions. |
| **Persistent** | Hard to shake or continues over time. | Repeating saves, tracking the party across zones. |
| **Disorienting** | Warps the player's sense of direction or physics. | Axis flips, movement penalties. |
| **Vertical** | Interacts with ceilings, vents, or shafts. | Climbing boons, dropping from above. |
| **Violent** | Brutal and physically overwhelming. | High Strike counts, destruction of environment. |
| **Hazard** | Environmental dangers that aren't sentient threats. | Forced movement, oxygen depletion, zone damage. |
| **Environmental** | Bound to the ship's physical state. | Triggered by system failure or damage. |
| **Mobile** | Capable of moving between zones. | Pursuing players, changing patrol routes. |
| **Automated** | Follows a pre-programmed loop or logic. | Predictable but relentless behavior. |
| **Decoy** | Uses deception, mimicry, or distraction. | Luring players, false signals, surprise attacks. |
| **Stealth** | Focuses on remaining undetected. | Boons to stay hidden, surprise strikes. |
