# 🏷️ Tag Registry (Designer Guide)

**INTERNAL DESIGN DOCUMENT**: Use this registry to ensure thematic consistency across different archetypes. 

### 🪙 The Universal Resource: Echoes
SciFi v5 uses a single pool of dual-sided tokens—**Echoes**—to track all non-physical pressure.
*   **⚪ Signal (Side A)**: Clarity, Resolve, and Luck.
*   **⚫ Static (Side B)**: Distortion, Trauma, and Glitches.
*   **🪙 Committing**: Tokens can be set aside (Committed) to track **Durations** or **Conditions**.
*   **The Void**: When a player has **0 Echoes**, all resource-based triggers (Flip/Discard) deal a **Strike** directly.
