## 🏗️ Character Creation & Loadout

### The Signature Trio
Every character starts with a **5-Slot Loadout**. At character creation, players must select:
1.  **[DEFENSE] (Pick 1)**: Occupies **1 Slot**. Provides health and avoidance.
2.  **[BOON] (Pick 1)**: Occupies **1 Slot**. Provides passive mastery.
3.  **The Remaining 3 Slots**: Can be filled with any combination of **[ABILITY]** or **[ITEM]** cards.
    *   **[ABILITY]**: Usually occupies 0-1 Slots.
    *   **[ITEM]**: Occupies 1-2 Slots as indicated.

Players can discover **Loot** cards during a session, but they must always stay within their **5-Slot** limit, dropping equipment if necessary to make room.
