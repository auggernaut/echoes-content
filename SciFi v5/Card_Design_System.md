## 🏗️ Character Creation & Loadout

### The Signature Trio
Every character starts with a **5-Slot Loadout**. At character creation, players must select:
1.  **[DEFENSE] (Pick 1)**: Occupies **1 Slot**. Provides health and avoidance.
2.  **[BOON] (Pick 1)**: Occupies **1 Slot**. Provides passive mastery.
3.  **The Remaining 3 Slots**: Can be filled with any combination of **[ABILITY]** or **[ITEM]** cards.
    *   **[ABILITY]**: Usually occupies 0-1 Slots.
    *   **[ITEM]**: Occupies 1-2 Slots as indicated.

Players can discover **Loot** cards during a session, but they must always stay within their **5-Slot** limit, dropping equipment if necessary to make room.

## 🌎 Location Design & Scenario Interplay

### 1. Evergreen Versatility (The "Menu" Approach)
Location cards are designed to be **evergreen**. They do not contain scenario-specific text. Instead, they provide a "Menu" of atmospheric and hazard-based elements that a GM can adapt to any story.

*   **Front (Player-Facing)**: Pure sensory immersion. Vivid descriptions and a bulleted list of physical **Features**.
*   **Back (GM-Facing)**: A toolbox of **Hazards** (immediate dangers) and **Reveals** (secrets or plot advancement).

### 2. Scenario-Card Interplay
In **SciFi v5**, the story is a collaboration between the **Scenario Guide** (The Logic) and the **Adventure Deck** (The Environment).

*   **Scenario Guide**: Defines the *Why* and *Who*. It provides the Hook, NPC motivations, and specific Threat tactics.
*   **Cards**: Define the *Where* and *What*. A single [MedBay] card can be a site of bio-horror in one scenario and a tech-mystery in another, depending on which **Hazards** or **Reveals** the GM selects from the card's menu.

### 3. GM as the Weaver
The GM is the bridge between the scenario and the table. 
*   **Hidden Information**: Players should **never** see the back of a GM card (Location, NPC, Threat). This preserves the "Reveals" as genuine surprises.
*   **Narrative Adaptation**: GMs are encouraged to pick the Hazard or Reveal that best fits the scenario's current tension. If the mission is about a leak, use the "Corrosive Leak" hazard; if it's about a ghost, use the "Ghost Signal" reveal.
