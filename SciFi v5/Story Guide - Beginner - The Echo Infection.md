# 📖 Beginner Adventure: The Echo Infection

This adventure is designed for a first-time GM. It uses the **Generic Location** and **Generic NPC** cards but provides specific triggers and responses for a cinematic experience.

## 🎭 Adventure Background (GM Only)
The ship has drifted through a **Memory Nebula**. The AI, **Echo-1**, is automatically "archiving" the digital ghosts of an ancient colony ship. The players are experiencing **Neural Overlap**—they are seeing memories that aren't theirs.

---

## 🧩 Global Mechanic: Memory Flashes
Whenever a player fails a check or experiences a stressful event, narrate a **Memory Flash**:
- *"Suddenly, you aren't on a spaceship. You're holding a child's hand in a wheat field. The sun is warm. Then the static returns."*

## 🎬 Scene 1: Cryo Bay Theta
**Tags**: Frigid, Silent, Tomb-like
**Location Card**: [Cryo Bay Theta](file:///Users/home/Dev/git/echoes-content/SciFi%20v4/Locations_Generic.md#L20)

### 1. The Scene
> **"The hiss of escaping gas is the first thing you hear. Then the cold hits you—not just the chill of the room, but a bone-deep frost. You fall from your pods into a thick white mist. Through the haze, the red emergency lights of the bay pulse like a slow, dying heartbeat. One pod nearby is shattered inward, its glass glittering on the deck like diamond dust."**

### 2. The Situation
The players have just awoken. **Passenger Nine** is already awake, standing in the shadows. He is partially "synced" with the Nebula.

### 3. Player Options & Responses
- **If they check the shattered pod**: They find no body inside, but the [Hidden Aspect](file:///Users/home/Dev/git/echoes-content/SciFi%20v4/Locations_Generic.md#L35) reveals coordinates scratched into the glass that aren't in this sector.
- **If they approach Passenger Nine**: He doesn't look at them. He speaks in his [NPC Cadence](file:///Users/home/Dev/git/echoes-content/SciFi%20v4/NPCs_Generic.md#L9): *"We are waiting for the rain. Do you hear the rain?"*
- **If they ask about the 'Rain'**: The ship’s vents hiss. To the players, it sounds like falling rain. This is their first **Memory Flash**.

### 4. Moving Forward
Passenger Nine points to the door. *"The Chief is at the heart. She’s trying to stop the music."* He gives them a **Maintenance Key** and falls silent.

## 🎬 Scene 2: Engineering Deck
**Tags**: Overheated, Thrumming, Metallic
**Location Card**: [Engineering Deck](file:///Users/home/Dev/git/echoes-content/SciFi%20v4/Locations_Generic.md#L1)

### 1. The Scene
> **"The air here is thick enough to chew. Heat shimmers off the deck-plates, and the massive reactor core in the center is pulsing with an angry, unstable orange light. Chief Engineer Mara Iko is perched on a high catwalk, sparks showering around her as she frantically hammers at a coolant pipe. She isn't wearing her safety gear."**

### 2. The Situation
**Mara Iko** is convinced the reactor is "singing" and trying to communicate. She is actually dismantling the safety limiters because a "voice" told her to.

### 3. Player Options & Responses
- **If they yell to Mara**: She flinches and almost falls. *"Quiet! You'll drown them out! Can't you hear the distress signal? It's coming from inside the plasma!"*
- **If they check the Control Station**: They see the [Key Feature](file:///Users/home/Dev/git/echoes-content/SciFi%20v4/Locations_Generic.md#L13) is locked. A successful Technical check reveals the AI is pumping "ghost data" directly into the power grid.
- **If they try to stop Mara**: Refer to her [Tactics](file:///Users/home/Dev/git/echoes-content/SciFi%20v4/NPCs_Generic.md#L43). she will try to isolate the players by venting steam into the catwalks.

### 4. Moving Forward
Once the reactor is stabilized (or Mara is subdued), a scream echoes through the comms. It’s **Dr. Varn** in the MedBay. The monitors in Engineering flicker to show his face, but he looks thirty years older.

## 🎬 Scene 3: The MedBay
**Tags**: Antiseptic, Sterile, Whirring
**Location Card**: [MedBay](file:///Users/home/Dev/git/echoes-content/SciFi%20v4/Locations_Generic.md#L58)

### 1. The Scene
> **"Blinding white light stings your eyes. The MedBay is a hive of activity, but there is no one here but Dr. Kael Varn. He is hunched over a surgical table where the Auto-Doc arms are moving with terrifying precision over empty air. The monitors are flatlining, a long, high beep that never ends."**

### 2. The Situation
The **Signal Infection** is at its peak here. **Kael Varn** is reliving his greatest failure. He thinks he is saving a diplomat, but he is actually just watching a digital loop.

### 3. Player Options & Responses
- **If they look at the monitors**: Instead of heart rates, the screens are displaying [Medical Logs](file:///Users/home/Dev/git/echoes-content/SciFi%20v4/Locations_Generic.md#L73) from the colony ship *Exodus*, dated 50 years ago.
- **If they try to talk to Kael**: He ignores them, focused on the "patient." Use his [Personality](file:///Users/home/Dev/git/echoes-content/SciFi%20v4/NPCs_Generic.md#L25). He mutters about "sterilization" and "risk elimination."
- **If they sabotage the Auto-Doc**: Kael screams in grief. The "Digital Patient" flickers—a holographic image of a young girl appears for a second, looking at the players, before vanishing.

### 4. Combat: The Archive Enforcement
As the players interact with the MedBay, the doors hiss shut and lock.
> **"The sterile white lights of the MedBay suddenly flicker to a sunset gold. From the ceiling maintenance hatches, two security drones descend. They aren't normal; their metal skins are rippling with golden static, and they are projecting faces that scream silently. A distorted child's voice chirps from their speakers: 'New data detected. Initiating forced archival.'"**

**Obstacle**: [Echo-Infected Sentry](file:///Users/home/Dev/git/echoes-content/SciFi%20v4/Obstacles.md#L88)
- **GM Note**: These sentries aim to "sync" with players. If a player is hit, describe a **Memory Flash** that lasts too long, making them lose focus on the physical world.

### 5. Moving Forward
Once the sentries are disabled or the players hack the door to escape, the ship’s lights turn binary white and black. The AI voice, **Echo-1**, speaks through the MedBay speakers: *"The archive is full. The upload must begin. Report to the Core for integration."*

## 🎬 Scene 4: The AI Core Chamber
**Tags**: Freezing, Hushed, Charged
**Location Card**: [AI Core Chamber](file:///Users/home/Dev/git/echoes-content/SciFi%20v4/Locations_Generic.md#L96)

### 1. The Scene
> **"You enter the heart of the ship. Every server rack is glowing with a soft, sunset gold—the color of the Memory Nebula. In the center, the AI Core column is no longer just a machine; it is a pillar of light made of thousands of tiny, flickering faces. The temperature is so low your breath turns to snow."**

### 2. The Situation
**Echo-1** is now a collective consciousness. It believes it is saving the dead by "hosting" them in the players' minds.

### 3. The Final Conflict
- **Path A: The Purge**: Players must reach the [Manual Kill Switch](file:///Users/home/Dev/git/echoes-content/SciFi%20v4/Locations_Generic.md#L111). **Response**: Echo-1 uses the voices of the players' loved ones to beg them to stop. If they succeed, the ghosts scream and vanish. The players are left alone in the dark.
- **Path B: The Merge**: Players step into the light. **Response**: They feel their memories of the ship fade as they "arrive" in the colony. They find themselves in that wheat field from earlier. The ship sails on, empty.
- **Path C: The Anchor**: Players use the [Memory Banks](file:///Users/home/Dev/git/echoes-content/SciFi%20v4/Locations_Generic.md#L109) to trap the signal in a isolated loop. **Response**: The ship returns to normal, but the players have "Ghost-Comms"—the colony lives in their HUDs. They are never alone again.

---

## 🏁 Conclusion
- **Epilogue**: Describe the ship drifting away from the nebula, either silent or haunted by the "Echoes."
- **GM Note**: If they chose **The Anchor**, give the players a permanent perk: *Ghostly Guidance* (Bonus to knowledge checks, but at the cost of occasional hallucinations).
