## Universal Multi-Tool

**Front (Player View)**
*Image: A heavy, industrial-grade folding tool with a glowing plasma torch attachment.*

**Back (Item Details)**
*   **Function:** Grants advantage on Engineering and Technical checks related to physical repairs or hacking.
*   **Risk:** [Sticky Trigger]: If used for a desperate repair (rolling a 1), the plasma torch triggers fire suppression (Bane on all actions in the room for 1 turn due to foam/halon).
*   **Mechanical Benefit:** Once per session, automatically succeed on a "Minor Repair" check.
*   **Narrative Twist:** The tool has the name "Mara Iko" etched into the casing.

## Thermal Vision Goggles

**Front (Player View)**

## Vibration Sensor

**Front (Player View)**
*Image: A small, circular hub that suction-cups to a bulkhead, showing a ripple-pattern display.*
A handheld hub that connects to the ship's skin. It "feels" the vibrations in the hull. It doesn't tell you *what* is moving, only *where* and *how heavy*.

**Back (Item Details)**
*   **Function:** Detects movement through walls, floors, or vents by hull resonance.
*   **Mechanical Benefit:** Boon on Scouting rolls. On a Success, the GM tells you the size of the movement (Titan, Humanoid, Small).
*   **Drawback:** [Blind Resonance]: Cannot distinguish between a crewmate and a monster. If two sources of movement are present, you must guess or roll Will 5+ to focus.
*   **Narrative Twist:** The sensor picks up a rhythmic "thump-thump" coming from the empty void outside the hull.

## Thermal Siphon

**Front (Player View)**
*Image: A canister with cooling fins that rapidly frosts over when activated.*

*   **Function:** Flash-freezes a 10ft area.
*   **[BURN]:** Discard after one use.

*   **[BURN]:** The power cell is consumed after one combat encounter.
*   **Mechanical Benefit:** Provides a +2 bonus to "Defense/Survival" rolls while behind the shield.
