## Cryo Bay Theta
**Tags:** Frigid, Silent, Tomb-like

**Front (Player-Facing)**
*Image: Rows of vertical glass pods, some frosted or broken. Dim blue lighting. Mist covers the floor.*
A skin of frost turns the cryo‑pods into glass sarcophagi. One capsule is shattered inward, glittering with glass dust. Cold breath blooms in the air. Frozen stasis gel beads on the deck with an antiseptic sweetness.

**Back (GM Detail)**

## The Bridge
**Tags:** Static-hissing, Cracked, Abandoned

**Front (Player-Facing)**
*Image: Cracked viewport framing a starry void. Captain's chair in the center.*
A cracked viewport frames the void like a black coin. Chairs are still buckled; consoles breathe to life in uneven pulses, shedding static snow. A faint comm light blinks, trying to say something through the noise.

**Back (GM Detail)**
*   **Atmosphere:** Abandoned center of authority.
*   **Key Features:**
    *   **Captain’s Chair:** Central position with overrides.
    *   **Navigation Console:** Holographic map table (flickering).

## MedBay
**Tags:** Antiseptic, Sterile, Whirring

**Front (Player-Facing)**
*Image: High-tech hospital room. Surgical robots hanging from the ceiling. Sterile white and blue lighting.*
A chemical haze hangs like glittering dust in sterile light. Auto-doc arms twitch to life, then freeze mid-motion. The air smells like antiseptic and hot metal, with a sweetness that shouldn’t be there.

**Back (GM Detail)**
*   **Atmosphere:** Clinical and unwittingly hostile.
*   **Key Features:**
    *   **Auto-Doc:** Robotic surgical spider (Heal/Harm).
    *   **Fabricator:** Prints drugs/bandages (limited stock).
*   **Hazards:** Miscalibrated robots, toxic spills, quarantine lockdowns.
*   **Reveals:** Medical logs don't match crew manifest; bio-sample in the freezer (non-human).

## AI Core Chamber
**Tags:** Freezing, Hushed, Charged

**Front (Player-Facing)**
*Image: Dark server room with a central glowing monolith. Cables like tree roots.*
Cable looms gather like roots around a cold, black obelisk of memory lattice. The temperature drops with each step toward the core, and breath crystallizes in the air.

**Back (GM Detail)**
*   **Atmosphere:** Sacred, electrically charged temple.
*   **Key Features:**
    *   **The Interface:** Central terminal for ship AI.
    *   **Memory Banks:** Slots for AI data shards.
*   **Hazards:** Halon gas dumps (O2 removal), neuro-shock, freezing.
*   **Reveals:** A manual "kill switch" under floor plates; heat signatures in the server racks (nesting).

## Cargo Hold
**Tags:** Cavernous, Echoing, Shadowy

**Front (Player-Facing)**
*Image: Towering stacks of shipping containers creating dark canyons.*
Columns of cargo crates rise into the darkness above, forming a labyrinth of metal and plastic. Every distant clank or hiss echoes through the vast space, making it impossible to tell where sound originates. The scale makes you feel small and exposed.

**Back (GM Detail)**
*   **Atmosphere:** Oppressive scale, industrial neglect.
*   **Key Features:**
    *   **Cargo Containers:** Pried open like ribcages.
    *   **Catwalks:** Metal grating suspended over the abyss.
*   **Hazards:** Unstable stacks, high-voltage conduits, toxic fumes.
*   **Reveals:** A container labeled "Classified Bio-Hazard"; a trail of discarded gear leading to a vent.

## The Gut (Maintenance)
**Tags:** Cramped, Hissing, Vibrating

**Front (Player-Facing)**
*Image: Narrow maintenance shafts filled with hissing steam and low-hanging wires.*
The walls squeeze in. You can feel the ship's heartbeat through the vibrating steel. It's a claustrophobic vein of pipes, cables, and narrow crawlspaces. Every movement feels loud, and every hiss of steam feels like a breath.

**Back (GM Detail)**
*   **Atmosphere:** Claustrophobic dread, mechanical intimacy.
*   **Key Features:**
    *   **The Veins:** Narrow tunnels where one must crawl.
    *   **Power Junctions:** Humming nodes pulsing with lethal energy.
*   **Hazards:** [Cramped Combat] (Bane on rolls using large weapons like Rifles or Two-Handed tools), scalding steam.
*   **Reveals:** A makeshift "nest" made of shredded jumpsuits and copper wire; claw marks inside the ventilation ducts.

## Hydroponics Wing
**Tags:** Humid, Overgrown, Oxygen-Rich

**Front (Player-Facing)**
*Image: Rows of vertical glass tubes filled with bioluminescent algae and twisted, pale vines. The air is thick and smells of wet earth and ozone.*
The air here is sweet—too sweet. Oxygen levels are in the red, making your skin tingle. Pale vines creep out of shattered growth tanks, illuminated by the ghostly green glow of nutrient vats. The mist is thick enough to hide a predator.

**Back (GM Detail)**
*   **Atmosphere:** Tropical humidity, uncanny growth.
*   **Key Features:**
    *   **Oxygen Scrubbers:** Massive fans humming at triple speed.
    *   **Growth Tanks:** Shattered glass and spilling nutrient sludge.
*   **Hazards:** [Oversized Oxygen Levels] (Any use of fire or energy weapons that causes a Strike deals +1 additional Strike from the micro-detonation), slippery moss, low visibility.
*   **Reveals:** The central scrubber is choked with bio-matter; a crew member's skeleton half-merged with the vines.

## Observation Deck
**Tags:** Silent, Expansive, Star-lit

**Front (Player-Facing)**
*Image: Massive viewport showing distant stars. A large, circular room with scattered furniture and a layer of translucent slime on the glass.*
The ship’s hum is quiet here. The massive viewport looks out onto a field of distant stars, cold and indifferent. But the peace is broken: smeared across the usually pristine glass is a thick, translucent slime. A table lies overturned, and a trail of shiny objects—wrenches, datapads, silverware—leads toward the maintenance vents.

**Back (GM Detail)**
*   **Atmosphere:** Eerie stillness, celestial scale.
*   **Key Features:**
    *   **The Viewport:** High-strength glass, now smeared with slime.
    *   **Maintenance Vents:** Narrow access points to the ship's gut.
*   **Hazards:** Slippery slime (Bane on movement), low lighting.
*   **Reveals:** Deep claw marks on the pressure doors; the slime glows blue when scanned or touched.
