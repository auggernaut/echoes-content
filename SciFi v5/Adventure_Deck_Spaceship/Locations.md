## Reactor Core
**Tags:** Overheated, Thrumming, Metallic

**Front (Player-Facing)**
*Image: Massive cylindrical reactor core glowing with pulsing blue and orange light. Industrial, pipes, steam, heat distortion.*
The air tastes metallic. Heat shimmers off the deckplates. A half-lit reactor core looms in the chamber’s center, breathing in mechanical gasps. Every few seconds, the lights dim and pulse like a dying heartbeat.

**Back (GM Detail)**
*   **Atmosphere:** Oppressive heat, volatility.
*   **Key Features:**
    *   **The Core:** Shielded column requiring manual tuning.
    *   **Catwalks:** Metal grating slippery with oil.
*   **Hazards:** Electrical arcs, steam vents, radiation leaks.
*   **Reveals:** A maintenance crawlspace allows access to core couplings.

## Cryo Bay Theta
**Tags:** Frigid, Silent, Tomb-like

**Front (Player-Facing)**
*Image: Rows of vertical glass pods, some frosted or broken. Dim blue lighting. Mist covers the floor.*
A skin of frost turns the cryo‑pods into glass sarcophagi. One capsule is shattered inward, glittering with glass dust. Cold breath blooms in the air. Frozen stasis gel beads on the deck with an antiseptic sweetness.

**Back (GM Detail)**
*   **Atmosphere:** Tomb-like stillness, biting cold.
*   **Key Features:**
    *   **Cryo Pods:** Glass coffins, some occupied.
    *   **Revival Station:** Terminal for waking crew.
*   **Hazards:** Hypoxia, extreme cold exposure, ice.
*   **Reveals:** Scratches on the *inside* of a pod; a pod labeled "Empty" that contains bio-residue.

## The Bridge
**Tags:** Static-hissing, Cracked, Abandoned

**Front (Player-Facing)**
*Image: Cracked viewport framing a starry void. Captain's chair in the center.*
A cracked viewport frames the void like a black coin. Chairs are still buckled; consoles breathe to life in uneven pulses, shedding static snow. A faint comm light blinks, trying to say something through the noise.

**Back (GM Detail)**
*   **Atmosphere:** Abandoned center of authority.
*   **Key Features:**
    *   **Captain’s Chair:** Central position with overrides.
    *   **Navigation Console:** Holographic map table (flickering).
*   **Hazards:** Vacuum exposure, gravity fluctuations, electrical fires.
*   **Reveals:** A "black box" chip taped under a console; the comms picking up a ghost signal.

## MedBay
**Tags:** Antiseptic, Sterile, Whirring

**Front (Player-Facing)**
*Image: High-tech hospital room. Surgical robots hanging from the ceiling. Sterile white and blue lighting.*
A chemical haze hangs like glittering dust in sterile light. Auto-doc arms twitch to life, then freeze mid-motion. The air smells like antiseptic and hot metal, with a sweetness that shouldn’t be there.

**Back (GM Detail)**
*   **Atmosphere:** Clinical and unwittingly hostile.
*   **Key Features:**
    *   **Auto-Doc:** Robotic surgical spider (Heal/Harm).
    *   **Fabricator:** Prints drugs/bandages (limited stock).
*   **Hazards:** Miscalibrated robots, toxic spills, quarantine lockdowns.
*   **Reveals:** Medical logs don't match crew manifest; bio-sample in the freezer (non-human).

## AI Core Chamber
**Tags:** Freezing, Hushed, Charged

**Front (Player-Facing)**
*Image: Dark server room with a central glowing monolith. Cables like tree roots.*
Cable looms gather like roots around a cold, black obelisk of memory lattice. The temperature drops with each step toward the core, and breath crystallizes in the air.

**Back (GM Detail)**
*   **Atmosphere:** Sacred, electrically charged temple.
*   **Key Features:**
    *   **The Interface:** Central terminal for ship AI.
    *   **Memory Banks:** Slots for AI data shards.
*   **Hazards:** Halon gas dumps (O2 removal), neuro-shock, freezing.
*   **Reveals:** A manual "kill switch" under floor plates; heat signatures in the server racks (nesting).

## Cargo Hold / Maintenance Gut
**Tags:** Cavernous, Echoing, Shadowy

**Front (Player-Facing)**
*Image: Towering stacks of shipping containers creating dark canyons. Maintenance shafts and pipes.*
Columns of cargo crates rise into the darkness above, forming a labyrinth of metal and plastic. Every distant clank or hiss echoes through the vast space, making it impossible to tell where sound originates.

**Back (GM Detail)**
*   **Atmosphere:** Oppressive scale, industrial neglect.
*   **Key Features:**
    *   **Cargo Containers:** Some sealed, some pried open.
    *   **Maintenance Shafts:** Narrow tunnels through the ship's "gut."
*   **Hazards:** Unstable stacks, high-voltage conduits, toxic fumes.
*   **Reveals:** Container labeled "Classified Bio-Hazard"; makeshift living area hidden in a crate.

## Observation Deck
**Tags:** Silent, Expansive, Star-lit

**Front (Player-Facing)**
*Image: Massive viewport showing distant stars. A large, circular room with scattered furniture and a layer of translucent slime on the glass.*
The ship’s hum is quiet here. The massive viewport looks out onto a field of distant stars, cold and indifferent. But the peace is broken: smeared across the usually pristine glass is a thick, translucent slime. A table lies overturned, and a trail of shiny objects—wrenches, datapads, silverware—leads toward the maintenance vents.

**Back (GM Detail)**
*   **Atmosphere:** Eerie stillness, celestial scale.
*   **Key Features:**
    *   **The Viewport:** High-strength glass, now smeared with slime.
    *   **Maintenance Vents:** Narrow access points to the ship's gut.
*   **Hazards:** Slippery slime (Bane on movement), low lighting.
*   **Reveals:** Deep claw marks on the pressure doors; the slime glows blue when scanned or touched.
