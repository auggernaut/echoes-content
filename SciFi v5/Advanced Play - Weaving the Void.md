# 🌌 Advanced Play: Weaving the Void
## *Building Procedural Adventures with the Adventure Deck*

In **SciFi v5**, you don't always need a pre-written scenario. The **Adventure Deck** is a engine for generating infinite stories on the fly. This guide teaches you how to draw random cards and "weave" them into a cohesive, high-stakes session.

## 🎲 The Procedural Draw
To build an adventure from scratch, shuffle the individual card types and pull a "Seed Hand":

1.  **Seed Locations (Draw 2)**: These define the map and the atmosphere.
2.  **The Anchor (Draw 1 NPC)**: This is the person who drives the conflict or offers refuge.
3.  **The Pressure (Draw 1 Threat)**: This is the active force trying to break the crew.
4.  **The Catalyst (Draw 1 Loot)**: This is the "Why"—the item that everyone wants or needs.

## 🧪 Phase 1: Finding the Narrative Glue
*This is the "GM Thought Process." Look at your Seed Hand and ask: "Why are these things together?"*

### **Example Draw**
*   **Locations**: [Communications Array] + [Hydroponics Wing]
*   **NPC**: [Passenger Nine]
*   **Threat**: [Automated Turrets]
*   **Loot**: [AI Memory Shard]

### **The Weave (Internal Monologue)**
> *"Okay, I’ve got the **Array** (high, exposed, technical) and the **Hydroponics Wing** (low, humid, overgrown). **Passenger Nine** is my detached, listening NPC. The **Turrets** are an active security threat, and the **Memory Shard** is a technical goal.
>
> **The Narrative**: The ship's AI is fractured. A piece of its memory—the [AI Memory Shard]—was ejected during a hull breach and is snagged in the [Communications Array]. The ship's security [Turrets] has gone into 'Scorched Earth' mode, trying to burn out a 'mutation' in the [Hydroponics Wing] that is actually just Passenger Nine—who has uploaded part of his consciousness into the plant-mesh to survive.
>
> **The Goal**: The PCs must navigate the lethal security of the Hydroponics Wing to find Passenger Nine, then make a zero-G climb to the Communications Array to retrieve the Shard and restore the AI."*

## ⚓ Phase 2: Building the Hook
Once you have the Weave, turn it into a question for the players. **A good hook is a problem, not a description.**

*   **Bad Hook**: "You are in the Hydroponics Wing and see some turrets."
*   **Advanced Hook**: *"The oxygen in the ship is being replaced by the smell of burning leaves. You can hear the rhythmic 'thrum-thrum-thrum' of the Automated Turrets firing into the Hydroponics Wing. A distorted voice—Passenger Nine—is whispering through the comms: 'It’s forgetting me. If you don't find the Shard on the hull, the ship will finish its purge.'"*

## 🎢 Phase 3: The Dynamic Loop
As the session progresses, use the **back of the cards** (Hazards and Reveals) to respond to player choices.

1.  **If players are too fast**: Trigger a **Hazard** (e.g., "The steam pipes in the Wing explode, blocking the path").
2.  **If players are stuck**: Trigger a **Reveal** (e.g., "You find a maintenance hatch that leads directly to the ladder well").
3.  **If tension is low**: Activate the **Threat**. Describe the sound of the turrets tracking their movement through the walls.

## 🏆 Advanced Tip: Let the Players "Weave"
You don't have to do all the work. When a player rolls a high success, ask them to interpret the cards:
*   *"You found the [AI Memory Shard]. As you touch it, you see a flash of **Passenger Nine's** past. What is the one thing he was trying to hide from the ship's logs?"*

By letting the players answer, they become co-authors of the void.
