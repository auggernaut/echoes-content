# 📖 GM Education: The Stalker's Shadow
## *Teaching the Art of Card-Based Storytelling*

This guide is an alternate version of the **The Stalker's Shadow** adventure. While the original guide gives you the story, *this* version teaches you how to **build** that story using the Adventure Deck.

## 🃏 The Core Philosophy: Front vs. Back
In this system, cards have two sides:
1.  **The Front (Player Facing)**: Show this to the players. Use the image and the flavor text to describe the scene. It provides the initial "vibe" without giving away secrets.
2.  **The Back (GM Only)**: This is your toolkit. It contains **Reveals**, **Hazards**, and **Mechanical Rules** that you introduce only when players interact with the environment or succeed on rolls.

## 🎬 Scene 1: The Hook & The First Draw
### Setting the Stage
Read the intro hook: *"You are the on-duty maintenance crew... a proximity alarm has been tripped in the Observation Deck."*

### 🧱 Behind the Curtain: Drawing the Location
**Action**: Pull the **[Observation Deck]** card and place it on the table, image side up.

**How to GM this Card**:
-   **Look at the Front**: Use the description of "translucent slime" and "trail of shiny objects" to set the mystery.
-   **Look at the Back**: See the **Reveals** section. It mentions "Deep claw marks" and "Slime glows blue when touched." 
-   **The Player Interaction**: 
    -   If a player says: *"I check the door,"* tell them to roll. On a success (4+), you "activate" a Reveal from the back of the card: *"You see deep claw marks gouged into the steel."*
    -   **GM Tip**: You don't have to read the back word-for-word. Use the bullet points as prompts for your own narration.

## 🎬 Scene 2: Branching Paths & NPCs
After the players explore the Deck, **Specialist Aris** appears.

### 🧱 Behind the Curtain: Handling NPCs
**Action**: Draw the **[Specialist Aris]** card.

**How to GM this Card**:
-   **Tactics (Back)**: The card says she "drops from above." Use this! Have her drop from a vent to startle the players.
-   **Personality (Back)**: She is "professional and curt." Speak in short, decisive sentences when roleplaying her.
-   **The Choice**: Aris suggests the **Maintenance Gut**. If players investigate the console, they might find the **Hydroponics Wing**. 

**Action**: Lay out **[The Gut (Maintenance)]** and **[Hydroponics Wing]** face down. Let the players choose their route.

## 🎬 Scene 3: Interpreting Hazards & Loot
Depending on their choice, the players encounter a body or a survivor.

### 🧱 Behind the Curtain: Items as Narrative Rewards
**Action**: If they check the decoy/body in the Gut, give them the **[Universal Multi-Tool]** card.

**How to GM this Item**:
-   **The Twist (Back)**: The back says the tool has *"Mara Iko"* etched into it. When you hand the card to the player, say: *"As you wipe the grease off, you see a name etched into the side: Mara Iko. You recognize that name—she's the Chief Engineer."*
-   **Mechanical Reward**: Remind them this card gives a **Boon** (extra die) on repair tasks.

### 🧱 Behind the Curtain: Threats in the Shadows
In the **Cargo Hold**, the Stalker finally appears.

**Action**: Draw **[The Stalker]** and **[Vance (The Exterminator)]**.

**Interpret the Threat**:
-   **Abilities (Back)**: The Stalker has **[Lurker]**. This means if the players aren't looking at it, it gets a Boon. 
-   **GM Action**: Tell the players: *"The sound is coming from the rafters. Who is looking up?"* If no one says they are, the Stalker strikes with its Boon.
-   **Interpret the Ally**: Vance's back says he's "fatalistic." When he gives advice like *"Drive it toward the Reactor,"* make him sound like he's seen a hundred people die this way.

---

## 🎬 Scene 4: The Finale (Environmental Combat)
The players reach the final room.

### 🧱 Behind the Curtain: Hazards as Weapons
**Action**: Draw the **[Reactor Core]** card.

**How to GM the Environment**:
-   **Hazards (Back)**: Look for "Steam vents" and "Electrical arcs."
-   **Interpretation**: If a player says, *"I want to kill it with the environment,"* look at those hazards. Tell them: *"You see a high-pressure steam vent right behind the creature. If you can lure it there and smash the valve, it'll be cooked."*
-   **The Roll**: Use the "Hazards" to set the difficulty or the damage.

## 🏁 Conclusion: The "Pack Up"
Once the creature is dead, describe the aftermath. 

**GM Education Note**: You've just built a four-scene adventure using 5 Location cards, 2 Threat cards, 3 NPCs, and 1 Loot card. 
-   Notice how the **Backs** of the cards did the heavy lifting for you—they provided the stats, the secrets, and the twists.
-   Next time, try shuffling the Locations. What if the adventure started in the **MedBay**? How would the "Slime" Reveal change the vibe?

**You are now ready to construct your own echoes.**
