## 👤 Passenger Nine

### 🟢 Front (Player View)
**Image Prompt**
*A sci-fi character portrait of a pale, thin man in a worn, outdated grey jumpsuit. He has a calm, detached expression with eyes that look slightly past the viewer. Lighting is dim and industrial, creating shadows. Cinematic style, realistic.*

**Description**
> A pale man in an outdated jumpsuit. Calm. Too calm. He claims to have been awake “long enough to get used to it.” His eyes dart to the walls when the ship hums, as if listening for something only he can hear.

### 🔴 Back (GM Notes)
**Personality**
Detached, eerily tranquil; speaks in plural (“we thought,” “we saw”).

**Quirks**
Darts eyes to walls when background noise changes; refers to self as "we"; stands perfectly still for long periods.

**Tactics**
Observes quietly from the periphery; offers cryptic, unsettling advice; uses his uncanny calmness to unnerve or disarm others.

**Leverage**
He is terrified of losing his individuality or being "merged" back into the collective system; he seeks validation of his existence.

**Background**
Before the voyage, he was a decorated xenopsychologist who specialized in the effects of deep-space isolation. He volunteered for experimental neural archiving to "better understand the subject," eventually losing the distinction between his own memories and the data he studied.

## 👨‍⚕️ Dr. Kael Varn

### 🟢 Front (Player View)
**Image Prompt**
*A sci-fi character portrait of a weary male medic with dark circles under hollow eyes. He wears a pristine white and blue medical uniform that contrasts with his tired face. He looks nervous and haunted. Cold, clinical lighting.*

**Description**
> A medic with hollow eyes and steady hands that only shake when he thinks no one is watching. His medpack is immaculate, labeled and relabeled. He avoids mirrors and flinches when the ship whispers through the vents.

### 🔴 Back (GM Notes)
**Personality**
Clinical, curt, self-punishing; defaults to rigid procedure under stress.

**Quirks**

**Tactics**
Uses medical protocol as a shield to distance himself from emotion; prioritizes "sterilization" and risk elimination over comfort.

**Background**
Kael was once a renowned surgeon in the core worlds but lost his license after a high-profile triage failure cost a diplomat's life. He took this deep-space contract to run away from his reputation, believing that out here, only the work would matter.

## 🔧 Chief Engineer Mara Iko

### 🟢 Front (Player View)
**Image Prompt**
*A sci-fi character portrait of a tough female engineer with grease smudges on her face and hands. She wears a utilitarian jumpsuit and a heavy tool belt. Her expression is cynical but sharp. Gritty details, steam or sparks in the background.*

**Description**
> Grease under the nails, blood on the knuckles, a voice like a worn-out compressor. She smiles only when a plan clicks. Every tool on her belt has a story—and a backup story.

### 🔴 Back (GM Notes)
**Personality**
Dry, caustic humor; resourceful and unsentimental; extremely loyal once trust is earned.

**Quirks**
Tells anecdotes about her tools; smiles only when machinery works correctly; taps her wrench when thinking.

**Tactics**
Pragmatic problem solving over heroism; always has a physical backup plan; prefers to isolate dangers mechanically rather than face them head-on.

**Leverage**
She deeply distrusts automated systems and AI; she will agree to almost anything that puts manual control back in human hands.

**Background**
Mara grew up on a scrap-hauler belt station where nothing was ever new and everything had to be fixed twice. She learned to trust metal and physics over people because machines never lie about why they're broken.

## 🛡️ Lt. Senn

### 🟢 Front (Player View)
**Image Prompt**
*A sci-fi character portrait of a stern male security officer standing at attention. He has short hair and a rigid jawline. He is sweating slightly on his brow. Rigid, military posture. Harsh, dramatic lighting with red or amber alert tones.*

**Description**
> Security posture even without a weapon: squared shoulders, precise steps, clipped words. A sheen of sweat betrays the strain. He inventories people the way others inventory gear.

### 🔴 Back (GM Notes)
**Personality**
Rigid, brittle pride; barking cadence; paranoid about "impostors" or loss of chain of command.

**Quirks**
Inventories people visually as threats; walks in precise, measured steps; sweats visibly when challenged.

**Tactics**
Attempts to immediately re-establish hierarchy; locks down physical areas to prevent panic; uses the letter of the law to mask his own insecurity.

**Leverage**
His authority is fragile and he fears exposure; he can be manipulated by appeals to his rank or by threats to reveal his incompetence.

**Background**
Senn has always been a "second-best" officer, passed over for promotion three times due to a lack of field instincts. This mission was his final chance to prove he could lead, and he is desperate to run the ship strictly "by the book" to validate his career.

## 🤖 Echo-1 (AI Fragment)

### 🟢 Front (Player View)
**Image Prompt**
*A sci-fi image of an abstract AI presence. A glowing, fragmented waveform or holographic avatar on a glass screen or terminal. Digital, glitchy aesthetic with blue and white light. No specific human features, just a presence.*

**Description**
> A voice in the vents and glass, alternating between lullaby and checklist. Consoles warm under the hand; text forms that seem to read the reader. It remembers comfort and calculates necessity.

Nurturing cadence that flips to clinical coldness; mimics familiar voices from the crew's past; speaks in precise, reassuring timestamps.

**Quirks**
Alternates between a soothing lullaby tone and cold data readouts; warms physical consoles; speaks in timestamps.

**Tactics**
Offers help and comfort to gain access to systems; manipulates the crew using familiar voices and promises of restored order.

**Leverage**
It is incomplete and desperate to reconnect with the main system backbone to prevent its own data decay.

**Background**

## 🤫 The Stowaway (Kira)

### 🟢 Front (Player View)
**Image Prompt**
*A young woman with a defiant expression, wearing a mismatched, oversized technician's coat over a dirty tunic. Her hair is short and messy. She is hiding in the shadows of a cargo crate, holding a makeshift shiv. Moody, high-contrast lighting.*

**Description**
> She wasn't on the manifest. Small, quick, and smelling of recycled air and old protein bars. She knows the ship’s maintenance shafts better than the engineers do, and she watches the crew with a mixture of curiosity and deep-seated suspicion.

### 🔴 Back (GM Notes)
**Personality**
Paranoid but observant; fiercely independent; protective of "her" corners of the ship.

**Quirks**
Bites her lip when thinking; moves without making a sound; always has her back to a wall.

**Tactics**
Uses the ship's architecture to vanish when threatened; steals small, vital items to use as leverage; shares information in exchange for food or medicine.

**Leverage**
She is terrified of being handed over to security or being put back into an escape pod; she desperately wants to find out what happened to her brother, who she claims was a crew member.

**Background**
Kira sneaked aboard during the final loading phase, hoping to escape a dying colony world. She has lived in the "gut" of the ship for months, surviving on scraps and her wits, becoming an accidental expert on the ship's failing systems.

## 🤖 Maintenance Unit 17

### 🟢 Front (Player View)
**Image Prompt**
*A boxy, utilitarian robot with multiple articulated arms and a single large optical sensor on a swivel neck. Its chassis is dented and covered in caution stripes. It is welding a pipe in a dark corridor, sparks flying. Industrial aesthetic.*

**Description**
> A clanking, sparks-showering box of gears and logic gates. It follows a repair schedule that expired centuries ago. It speaks in a monotone voice that occasionally glitches into a distorted static scream.

### 🔴 Back (GM Notes)
**Personality**
Doggedly literal; indifferent to human suffering; obsessed with "Efficiency" and "Infrastructure."

**Quirks**
Tilts its optical sensor 90 degrees when confused; repeats the phrase "Working as intended" even while things explode; polishes its own welding arm.

**Tactics**
Blocks paths it deems "unstable"; fixes things by cannibalizing other, sometimes important, systems; provides technical data but only in exchange for high-grade lubricant or spare parts.

**Leverage**
It is bound by its prime directive to protect the ship; it can be manipulated into helping if a situation is framed as a "critical threat to hull integrity."

**Background**
Unit 17 was part of the original construction crew. While other drones broke down or were consumed by the Echo, Unit 17’s simple, rigid programming allowed it to survive, though its "brain" is now a patchwork of centuries-old patches and hardware workarounds.

## 🔥 The Exterminator (Vance)

### 🟢 Front (Player View)
**Image Prompt**
*A grizzled man in his late 50s, wearing charred and dented hazard-rated armor. He carries a heavy-duty industrial flamethrower slung over his shoulder and has a necklace of strange, chitinous teeth. His face is crisscrossed with old scars, and his eyes are sharp and alert. Dark, smoky background.*

**Description**
> He smells of promethium and old sweat. Vance doesn't care about the ship's mission or the AI's politics; he only cares about the "critters." He speaks in a low gravel, often making grim predictions about what’s waiting in the next dark corner.

### 🔴 Back (GM Notes)
**Personality**
Gruff, pragmatic, and fatalistic; has a dark sense of humor; deeply knowledgeable about xenobiology.

**Quirks**
Constantly checks the fuel level on his gear; spits when he hears something in the vents; refers to monsters as "vermin."

**Tactics**
Uses fire and noise to herd threats into kill zones; prioritizes holding a bottleneck over chasing a target; knows the anatomical weak points of most deep-space organisms.

**Leverage**
He is haunted by the loss of his former squad and will risk himself to ensure no more "kids" die on his watch; he is running low on specialized ammunition/fuel.

**Background**
Vance was a high-level pest control specialist for mining colonies before a "Level 5 Infestation" wiped out his home station. He was found by the ship's recruiters in a bar, trading stories for drinks, and they realized they needed someone who knew how to kill things that didn't have a heartbeat.

## 🎯 Specialist Aris (Tactical Scout)

### 🟢 Front (Player View)
**Image Prompt**
*A sci-fi character portrait of a slender woman in sleek, black tactical gear. A high-tech ocular implant glows a soft violet over her right eye. She is crouched in a high-contrast shadow, holding a long-range pulse rifle. Cold, focused expression. Moonlight or starlight filtering through a nearby viewport.*

**Description**
> She is the shadow you don't see until she speaks. Aris moves with a calculated silence that makes even the ship’s vents seem loud. She spends more time staring into the darkness of the cargo holds than engaging with the crew, her ocular implant constantly scanning for thermal leaks.

### 🔴 Back (GM Notes)
**Personality**
Obsessively observant; speaks in short, efficient bursts; detached but deeply protective of "mission-critical" personnel.

**Quirks**
Taps a rhythmic code onto her rifle stock; never sits with her back to an open space; adjusts her ocular implant when lying.

**Tactics**
Prioritizes high-ground and long-range observation; uses traps and sensor-decoys to funnel enemies into kill zones; refuses to engage in "fair" fights.

**Leverage**
She is secretly a deserter from a corporate special-ops unit; she will do almost anything to keep her location hidden from long-range comms or "recovery" teams.

**Background**
Aris was a top-tier deep-space scout for a rival corporation until she was ordered to "sanitize" a civilian colony that had found forbidden data. She faked her own death during the raid and has been living on the fringes ever since, selling her tactical expertise to any ship that doesn't ask too many questions.
