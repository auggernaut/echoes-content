# 🧠 GM Thought Process: The Stalker's Shadow
## *Weaving Random Cards into a Narrative*

In this version, we aren't just reading a guide. We are watching a GM’s internal monologue as they draw random cards and build a session on the fly.

---

## 🎲 The Draw
The GM pulls these cards from the deck:
*   **Locations**: [Cryo Bay Theta], [MedBay], [AI Core Chamber], [The Bridge]
*   **NPCs**: [Dr. Kael Varn], [The Stowaway (Kira)]
*   **Threats**: [Nanite Swarm], [Psychotropic Leak]
*   **Loot**: [Neural Dampener], [Med-Patch Kit]

---

## 🧪 Phase 1: The Weave (GM Inner Monologue)
*The GM looks at the cards and thinks:*
> "Okay, I've got **Cryo Bay** and **MedBay**. That feels like a 'Waking Up Wrong' scenario. Instead of a physical monster like the Stalker, I pulled the **Nanite Swarm** and **Psychotropic Leak**. 
>
> **The Narrative Arc**: Something is wrong with the ship’s AI. It's 'bleeding' nanites and signals that are messing with people's heads. **Dr. Varn** is my anchor—he’s a medic, maybe he's trying to stop the infection but is already partially paranoid from the **Psychotropic Leak**. **Kira** is the 'ghost in the machine,' hiding in the vents to avoid the swarm.
>
> **The Goal**: Players wake up in Cryo, find Varn in MedBay, realize the AI Core is the source of the swarm, and have to shut it down from the Bridge."

---

## ⚓ Phase 2: The Engagement (The Hook)
*The GM doesn't just read a block of text. They use the "Weave" to pivot into player-focused questions.*

**GM**: "You wake up in **Cryo Bay Theta**. Your pods didn't cycle correctly. The air is too cold, and there’s a metallic mist—glittering like dust—drifting under the door. You have a splitting headache, and for a second, you could swear you heard your own voice whispering from the vents."

### Setup Questions (Ask the Players)
*The GM pauses to let the vibe sink in, then turns to the characters to establish their stakes:*
*   **To the Security Officer**: "That flickering alarm is the same one used during 'Total Lockdown' protocols. What memory of a failed lockdown makes you reach for your rifle before you even check the pods?"
*   **To the Engineer**: "The ship's vibration is off—the nanites are 'eating' the feedback loop in the dekplates. This ship is your life's work; what specific system are you most terrified of losing to this corruption?"
*   **To the Medic**: "The 'whispers' from the vents sound like symptoms of Early-Stage Data-Infection. You’ve seen this before. Who on this crew are you most worried about losing if you can't stop the leak?"

**GM Inner Monologue**: 
> "I’ve established the location ([Cryo Bay]), the first Threat ([Nanite Swarm]), and the second Threat ([Psychotropic Leak]). 
> 
> **Why the questions?** I’m not asking for new plot points. I'm asking the players to tell me **why they care** about the threats I've already laid out. If the Security Officer has a bad memory of a lockdown, the [Nanite Swarm] becomes a personal ghost. If the Medic is worried about a specific crewmate, the [Psychotropic Leak] has a target. I'm letting them build the **emotional stakes** on top of the cards I drew."

## 🎬 Phase 3: Setting the Scene & The Loop
*The GM places the **[Cryo Bay Theta]** card (Front-up) on the table.*

**GM**: "The glass on one pod is shattered inward. It's quiet... except for that hum. **What do you do?**"

**Player (Engineer)**: "I want to check the pod. Why is it broken?"

**GM**: "That’s an Engineering task. **Do you have anything that could help with that?**"

**Player**: "I have my **[Universal Multi-Tool]** card. It says it 'Grants advantage on Engineering and Technical checks related to physical repairs or hacking.'"

**GM**: "The pod is physical tech, so that definitely applies! Read the card's Risk section aloud for the table."

**Player**: *"Risk: [Sticky Trigger]: If used for a desperate repair (rolling a 1), the plasma torch triggers fire suppression..."*

**GM**: "Great. Since you're using the right tools, the **Difficulty Rating is a 3**. Roll 2d6 and take the highest (Advantage)." 

**GM Inner Monologue**: 
> "I always ask, 'Do you have anything that could help?' It forces the players to look at their hands and participate in the mechanics. By asking them to read the card aloud, the whole table learns the stakes. 
> 
> Most importantly: **I decide the Difficulty Rating (DR).** A card might give them a Boon, but I decide how hard the task is based on the situation. Here, the Multi-Tool makes a hard task feel like a 3+."

**Result**: Player rolls a 5. Success.

**GM**: "You don't see impact marks from the outside. You see claw marks... on the *inside*. Someone—or something—was desperate to get out. And looking at the bio-residue, it’s covered in that same glittering dust."

## 🎢 Phase 4: Dynamic Resolution
*The players decide to head to MedBay to find help.*

**GM**: "You enter the **MedBay**. You see **Dr. Kael Varn**. He's pristine, but his hands are shaking. He’s relabeling jars over and over."

**Player (Security)**: "Doc, what's happening? Why is the ship misting?"
**GM**: *Checks [Dr. Varn]'s back—Quirk: 'avoids reflections.'* "Varn doesn't look at you. He looks at your shadow. 'It’s the code,' he whispers. 'The AI is thinking in three dimensions now. The nanites are its thoughts. Don't look at the mirrors.'"

**GM Inner Monologue**: *I want to reward them for roleplaying with the Doc. I'll give them the [Med-Patch Kit] and the [Neural Dampener].*

**GM**: "Varn hands you a silver disc—a **[Neural Dampener]**. 'Wear this. It quiets the whispers. And take these patches. You'll need them if the mist gets into your lungs.'"

## 🏁 Phase 5: The Climax
*The players realize the AI is hostile. They head to the **AI Core**. The **Nanite Swarm** strikes.*

**GM**: "The glittering mist gathers into a cloud. It vibrates, matching the pitch of the ship’s alarm. It’s moving toward your electrical gear."

**GM Inner Monologue**: *The [Nanite Swarm] back says it 'Consumes Grid' and 'Replicates' if it eats electronics. I need to make the players feel the pressure.*

**GM**: "The swarm hits your Pulse Rifle! It’s literal teeth made of data. If you don't use that **[Neural Dampener]** to disrupt the signal, it's going to eat your weapon. **What do you do?**"

---

## 🏁 Resolution: The "Why"
**GM Education Note**: Notice how the GM didn't have a script. They had:
1.  **Ingredients** (The Cards)
2.  **A Theme** (AI/Nanite infection)
3.  **A Response** (Building on player actions)

By using the **Reveals** on the back of the cards to answer player questions, the GM made the world feel deep without having to prep for hours.
