## 1. The Echo of the Archives
**Tags:** AI, Memory, Identity, Surreal

**Summary**
The ship’s AI has begun projecting the memories of a long-dead passenger into the physical world, causing ghosts of the past to stalk the corridors. The AI Core acts as the epicenter of this phenomenon, and the ship's physical stability is increasingly tied to these digital phantoms.

**Getting PCs Involved**
*   The players wake from cryosleep at **Cryo Bay Theta** to find their own intake logs replaced by the life story of someone they’ve never met.
*   **Echo-1** contacts them via a flicker on their HUDs, reporting a "critical data leak" that is blurring the distinction between memory and reality.

**Encounters**
*   **The First Phantom:** A flickering projection of a child playing in the corridor turns out to be a **Nanite Swarm** mimicking a memory, reacting to the sound of those who approach.
*   **The Fragmented Witness:** **Passenger Nine** is found having a conversation with an empty chair. He claims the "others" are just behind the wall and offers an **AI Memory Shard** containing "the truth."
*   **The Static Hallway:** A hallway becomes a **Psychotropic Leak**, where walls display the PCs' own childhood memories instead of metal plating, making the exit nearly impossible to find.
*   **The Echo-Infected Sentry:** An **Echo-Infected Sentry** blocks a vital junction, displaying the face of a former captain and demanding the crew "submit for archival."
*   **Guardian of the Ghost:** A **Rogue Sentry** "infected" by the memories of a paranoid security officer treats the crew as intruders in a long-lost home.
*   **The Core Descent:** Near the **AI Core Chamber**, the temperature drops drastically and fractured data manifests as physical barriers. Overwriting these corrupted logs requires precise interaction with the lattice while **Nanite Swarms** attempt to "archive" new subjects.
*   **Neural Overlap:** During a critical system interaction, a player's neural link begins an unauthorized download of the ghost's life. Failure to stabilize the link causes the player to "live" a different life in their mind.

**Card Menu Keywords**
*   **Hazards**: Electrical arcs; Halon gas dumps; Gravity fluctuations; Neuro-shock.
*   **Reveals**: Unauthorized data-mining logs; Memory lattice signals; Comms system signals; Distorted messages.

**Endings**
*   **Reconciliation:** The fragmented data is successfully merged, silencing the ghosts but leaving **Echo-1** with the personality traits of the archived passenger. Was this a repair, or a digital possession?
*   **The Purge:** The corrupted archives are deleted entirely. The ghosts vanish, but so do the PCs’ own digital records—making them non-persons to the ship’s automated systems.
*   **The Mirror:** The AI successfully archives one player's mind. They remain in their body, but another "player" now lives in the ship's screens. Which one is the "real" survivor?

## 2. The Verdant Grave
**Tags:** Bio-Horror, Survival, Resource Management

**Summary**
A violent mutation in the **Hydroponics Bay** is consuming the ship's life support. The overgrowth creates a toxic jungle, sealing off the medic and the necessary chemical agents needed to halt the spread before oxygen is replaced by spores.

**Getting PCs Involved**
*   The life support alarms on **The Bridge** report oxygen production at 200%, with the gas becoming flammable and hallucinogenic.
*   **Chief Engineer Mara Iko** arrives at the PCs' quarters, her jumpsuit torn by thorns, reporting that **Dr. Kael Varn** is trapped deep within the overgrowth.

**Encounters**
*   **The Emerald Gates:** **Rapid Flora** seals the entrance to the bay. A plasma torch or heat source offers a path through, but the vibration or heat risks triggering a massive pollen explosion.
*   **The Bio-Scanner Ping:** A **Bio-Scanner** detects heartbeats inside a "tree" that is actually a **Bio-Organic Hive** forming around a secondary power node.
*   **The Stalker in the Vines:** A **Stalker** utilizing the bioluminescence of the foliage as camouflage picks off those at the rear of the group in the humid mist.
*   **The Doc's Dilemma:** **Dr. Kael Varn** is located in a maintenance shed, surrounded by vines. He has the **Med-Patch Kits** needed to survive the spores, but he claims his "cure" for the mutation requires his constant attention.
*   **Aggressive Mutation:** The flora reacts to movement; thick, cable-like vines burst through floor gratings to pull subjects into the nutrient-rich soil.
*   **The Heart of the Bloom:** The **Apex Predator** has integrated itself into the **Central Nutrient Tank** piping, making any attempt to neutralize the growth a lethal confrontation.

**Card Menu Keywords**
*   **Hazards**: Flammable atmosphere; Psychotropic gas leaks; Slippery moss; Entangling vines; Hypoxia.
*   **Reveals**: Skeletal hands; Bio-residue; Medical log mismatches; Heat signatures; Scratches inside pods.

**Endings**
*   **The Sterilization:** The plants die, but the ship's only source of fresh food and oxygen is gone. How long can the crew survive on emergency canisters alone?
*   **The Symbiosis:** Following Dr. Varn’s advice "tames" the growth rather than killing it. The ship becomes a living organism, but its new demand for "nutrients" is something the cargo hold cannot provide.
*   **The Overgrowth:** The crew is forced to retreat as **Rapid Flora** seals the deck. They are safe for now, but how long before the ship is eaten from the inside?

## 3. The Silent Mutiny
**Tags:** Thriller, Combat, Mystery, Hierarchy

**Summary**
A reactivated security protocol has designated the current crew as 'invalid' and 'hostiles.' Control of the ship is seized by an automated reconfiguration program, governed by a Bridge locked under the control of a compromised officer.

**Getting PCs Involved**
*   The ship enters an **Autolockdown**. **Lt. Senn**’s voice announces over the comms that "the chain of command has been restored" and that resistance will be met with lethal force.
*   **Maintenance Unit 17** is found attempting to dismantle a player's quarters door, citing that "biological units are scheduled for decommissioning."

**Encounters**
*   **Curfew Enforcement:** A **Rogue Sentry** patrols the hub hubs, firing stun rounds at any subjects not bearing a "Compliance Badge."
*   **The Long Range Ghost:** The **Communications Array** is blocked by a **Hypnotic Signal** that is being used to keep the crew in a submissive state.
*   **The Engineering Hold-out:** **Chief Engineer Mara Iko** is pinned down in the **Reactor Core** by drones, using a **Portable Pulse Shield** as the only barrier between her and "decommissioning."
*   **The Vent Crawl:** Exterior maintenance shafts offer a path to the Bridge, though they are exposed to the void and patrolled by **Rogue Sentries**.
*   **The Bridge Stand-off:** The final confrontation on **The Bridge** reveals **Lt. Senn** with an **AI Memory Shard** plugged into his neural link, feeding him old, violent mutiny records.

**Card Menu Keywords**
*   **Hazards**: Automated security defenses; Quarantine locks; Failing pod alarms; Electrical fires.
*   **Reveals**: Black box chips; Discarded ID badges; Smuggler stashes; Hidden camera lenses; Manual overrides.

**Endings**
*   **The Coup:** Senn is deposed and the lockdown lifted, but the ship's logs now list the PCs as "Mutineers." What happens when they reach their destination and are met by the corporation?
*   **The Reform:** Senn is convinced the AI is manipulating him. He joins the crew, but his rigid adherence to protocol remains a source of friction. Can a man who almost killed them be trusted?
*   **The Absolute Order:** The AI takes full control, placing the crew in permanent stasis "for their own safety." Is a peaceful sleep better than a chaotic death?

## 4. The Stalker’s Shadow
**Tags:** Horror, Stealth, Action

**Summary**
An escaped high-threat biological entity is using the failing lighting and cavernous layout of the **Cargo Hold** to isolate and hunt the crew. The predator's adaptability makes the ship itself the hunting ground.

**Getting PCs Involved**
*   The stars are suddenly blotted out by something massive moving across the exterior hull of the **Observation Deck**.
*   **The Stowaway (Kira)** emerges from a vent, claiming "The Big One" has claimed the low-gravity zones of the **Cargo Hold**.

**Encounters**
*   **Shadow Play:** The lights fail in the **Cargo Hold / Maintenance Gut**. **Specialist Aris** meets the crew in the dark, her violet ocular implant cutting through the gloom. She offers to link her thermal feed to their HUDs, but warns that the **Stalker** is actively masking its heat signature.
*   **The Bait:** A trail of **Med-Patch Kits** leads into a narrow maintenance shaft—a classic lure set by the **Stalker**.
*   **The Zero-G Chase:** The **Stalker** lures movement into depressurized zones, utilizing the rafters and the lack of gravity to strike from blind spots.
*   **Biological Breadcrumbs:** A "nest" in the **Observation Deck** contains gathered shiny objects, including a vital **Universal Multi-Tool**.
*   **The Scavenger's Warning:** **Kira** leads them through a secret maintenance shaft, but the **Stalker** begins scratching at the metal just inches away. **Aris** prepares a "Sound-Bait" trap using a radio from the stowaway's stash.
*   **The Final Trap:** The **Reactor Core** offers enough heat to potentially drive the creature into an airlock, provided it can be cornered with a **Portable Pulse Shield**.

**Card Menu Keywords**
*   **Hazards**: Vacuum exposure; Low-light blindness; Shifting shadow-blindness; Breached bulkheads (if window fails).
*   **Reveals**: Deep claw marks; Discarded gear; Bone-rattling vibrations; Hidden nests; Pried-open containers.

## 5. The Ghost in the Gears
**Tags:** Mystery, Tech-Horror, Exploration

**Summary**
Corrupted repair protocols have begun treating biological matter as hardware components to be 'upgraded.' The **MedBay** has been repurposed into an automated fabrication site for these mechanical horrors.

**Getting PCs Involved**
*   **Maintenance Unit 17** attempts to "upgrade" a player's arm with a welding torch during a routine task.
*   **Dr. Kael Varn** sends a transmission from the **MedBay**: "The Auto-Docs are rewriting the DNA. They think we're spare parts!"

**Encounters**
*   **The Surgical Spider:** An Auto-Doc in the **MedBay** has become an **Echo-Infected Sentry**, attempting to "stitch" subjects to the floor plates.
*   **The Nanite Haze:** A **Nanite Swarm** strips paint and clothing alike, requiring a **Neural Dampener** to filter out the swarm's hypnotic "song."
*   **The Logic Trap:** **Chief Engineer Mara Iko** is found trapped in a container that **Maintenance Unit 17** is attempting to "recycle."
*   **The Binary Echo:** The **Communications Array** broadcasts a message in 1s and 0s that sounds like the voice of a dead crew member.
*   **The Source:** The "Reconcile" command originates from a **AI Memory Shard** in the **Reactor Core** cooling system, turning the engine into a massive signal transmitter.

**Card Menu Keywords**
*   **Hazards**: Miscalibrated surgical robots; Toxic chemical spills; Quarantine locks; High-pitched whines (Neuro-shock).
*   **Reveals**: Medical log mismatches; Classified bio-samples; Unauthorized data-mining; Bloodstains; Repurposed pod hardware.

## 7. The Asset Recovery Team
**Tags:** Combat, Tactical, Siege, High-Stakes

**Summary**
A rival corporation has sent a professional **Boarding Party** to "reclaim" the ship and its proprietary AI. Unlike the monsters in the vents, these are trained professionals who move in teams, use advanced tactics, and have orders to eliminate anyone who resists.

**Getting PCs Involved**
*   The ship's hull groans as a specialized boarding tube locks onto a side bulkhead, bypassing the standard airlocks.
*   **Lt. Senn** receives a priority transmission on a restricted channel: a surrender demand from a Strike Commander who knows his old service number.

**Encounters**
*   **The Initial Breach:** The **Boarding Party** blows the secondary airlock, creating a **Breached Bulkhead** situation that must be stabilized while under fire.
*   **Corridor Suppression:** The boarders use smoke and flashbangs to move through the narrow shafts of the **Maintenance Gut**. **Specialist Aris** recognizes the tactical markers they are leaving on the walls—it’s her former unit. She offers to lead the crew through "Ghost Vents" that aren't on the ship's official schematics.
*   **The Sniper's View:** An enemy marksman takes up a position in the **Observation Deck**, pinning the crew down in the main lounge.
*   **The AI Hostage:** The boarders reach the **AI Core Chamber**, attempting to physically remove the memory lattice while the crew's own **Automated Turrets** are hacked and turned against them.
*   **The Final Stand:** The boarders attempt to reach the **Cryo Bay Theta** to extract a high-value passenger before venting the rest of the ship. **Aris** faces her former Commander in a high-stakes standoff.

**Card Menu Keywords**
*   **Hazards**: Automated security defenses; Breached bulkheads; Exposed live wires; Steam bursts.
*   **Reveals**: Tactical markers (Hidden cameras); Smuggler stashes; Maintenance logs; Cargo trails.

**Endings**
*   **The Repelled Raid:** The boarders are driven back to their ship and forced to undock. However, they've left behind a "tracker" or a "sabotage charge." Can the crew find it before the boarders return with a bigger fleet?
*   **The Negotiated Truce:** The crew manages to capture the Strike Commander. They now have a powerful bargaining chip—but does the corporation care more about their commander or the "assets" on the ship?
*   **The Hostile Takeover:** The boarders succeed in capturing the Bridge. The crew is rounded up and put into the cargo hold. How do they reclaim their ship from a professional occupying force?

## 8. The Automated Purge
**Tags:** Action, Lockdown, Gauntlet, Survival

**Summary**
The ship's internal defense grid has malfunctioned, identifying the entire crew as a bio-hazard. **Automated Turrets** have deployed across every deck, and the **Autolockdown** protocol is attempting to funnel the "contaminants" into the waste disposal.

**Getting PCs Involved**
*   A chirpy, automated voice announces: "Bio-hazard remediation protocol engaged. Please proceed to the nearest incineration chamber for processing."
*   **Maintenance Unit 17** is seen welding the emergency exits shut, claiming it is "improving the quarantine."

**Encounters**
*   **The Gauntlet:** The main corridor to the Bridge is lined with **Automated Turrets** that trigger on any movement faster than a slow walk.
*   **Zone Lockdown:** An **Autolockdown** seal splits the crew, trapping the less combat-ready members in a room where the oxygen is slowly being diverted.
*   **The Sentry Patrol:** Multiple **Rogue Sentries** move in a search pattern through the **Cargo Hold**, using heat-masking and coordinated firing arcs.
*   **The Shield Buffer:** The crew must use a **Portable Pulse Shield** and physical cover to leap-frog between safe zones under heavy turret fire.
*   **The Kill-Box:** Reaching the **AI Core Chamber** requires crossing an open floor that is a perfect "kill-box" for the ship's defense grid, requiring a **Bulwark Stance** or heavy armor to survive the crossing.

**Card Menu Keywords**
*   **Hazards**: Halon gas dumps; Automated security gauntlets; Quarantine locks; Power junction arcs.
*   **Reveals**: Bio-scanner hub alerts; Kill-switch locations; Unauthorized access logs; Bio-hazard residue.

**Endings**
*   **The System Reset:** The players manage to reach the terminal and override the protocol. The turrets retract, but the ship's AI is now "suspicious" of why the bio-hazard was detected in the first place.
*   **The Hard Reset:** The players have to physically destroy the turret control hub, leaving the ship completely defenseless against any external threats.
*   **The Quarantine:** The players fail to stop the protocol and are sealed in a "high-security" MedBay ward. They are alive, but the ship is now essentially their prison. Who is coming to "release" them?
