# Main Gate
Tags: Iron, Vines, Blood, Roses

A darkened, maw-shaped double gate of rusty iron, covered in vines, opens to a garden of decaying red roses embedded in blood, swaying without wind. A worn, stained black stone path, 8 feet wide, leads to the manor beyond. A tall vine fence extends from both sides of the gate into the night. Audible classical music emanates from the manor.

▶ [Blood Thrall]: Demand invitations to allow PCs entry. Attack if provoked or if the party gatecrashes.
▶ [Biting Gate]: The gate attacks unwelcome guests who approach.
▶ Look for another way in: the [Vine Fence] encircles the property, perhaps there’s another way in.


# Great Hall
Tags: Vampiric, Debauchery, Throne

Interior side of [Monstrous Doors] adorned with red metal veins, alive and pumping blood. They are flanked by two lines of columns, each decorated with scenes of vampiric debauchery, preying on all sorts of alien beings—and humans. At the end of the Hall is a Golden Throne shaped like skeletons and gold-plated.

▶ [Spiral Staircase] Winds up to the top floor from the corner of the room.
 
▶ Golden throne: touching it raises eyebrows; scraping gold off it takes time; destroying it reveals a ½ ton golden coffin (Kingly Wealth).


# Banshee Noble
Tags: Banshee, Unnatural

A striking spectral noblewoman with long, curling hair and sorrowful eyes. Her presence is regal and mournful. She wears shining jewelry that clings to memory like perfume on a ghost. One ring bears the crest of a forgotten house.

Undead: Immune to effects that affect living creatures (e.g. poison). Immune to mind-affecting or mind-reading spells (e.g. charm, hold, sleep).
Wail (1/encounter): All nearby lose take 1 additional Bane on all rolls unless they retreat or comfort her.
Possessive Grief: If attacked, she disappears and haunts the aggressor until soothed or dispelled
Weakness: A hidden truth may change her attitude towards you. 

# Vine Fence
Tags: Flora, Barrier, Blood

An imposing barbed fence towers twelve feet high, its rusty iron spikes lacquered with dried brown blood. Dark green vines wind their way through the barrier, their tendrils intertwining with the gruesome metal. 
▶ [Dark Vines] writhe as the heroes get closer. Climb over: they animate, attempting to impale intruders, draining their blood.
▶ Look for an opening: Broken and twisted metal shafts (as if melted) making a hole. Skeleton with charred bones nearby.
▶ Search the Skeleton: A pouch, a golden ring, scattered broken flasks, and 2 vials of [Holy Water].
▶ Shimmy through a Hole: Roll to beat DR2 or take 1 strike due to scraping against barbed wire.


# Biting Gate
Tags: Metal, Teeth, Mechanism, Trap

A colossal metal maw, its jagged teeth measuring two feet in length. The air vibrates with ominous grinding noises, a cacophony of rusty gears and aged mechanisms struggling to move. This terrifying apparatus, clearly of an otherworldly origin. Groans when approached.

Mundane damage immunity: Can only be harmed by magical attacks.
Spell immunity: Unaffected by sleep and charm spells.

On success: shakes off the trance and regains his senses, request help. On failure: lashes out in confusion, swings Barbed Sword. Still disoriented, vulnerable and partially under the trance.

# Guilded Entry Hall
Tags: Entry, Security

Stout oak inner doors, painted gold, stand open. A life-like dwarven statue with an outstretched hand greets visitors. A coat hanger holds dark, bloodstained coats. The air is thick with the mingling scents of perfume and blood emanating from within.

▶ Check the hanger: There’s a coat with an extra invitation. Additionally, 6 coats can be used as disguises. If they are all checked, the last has a finely crafted, bat-shaped gold pin (0 1).
▶ Put an invitation in the statue’s hand: Avoids sounding the alarm. Putting something else there delays the alarm 1d6 turns.

▶ Proceed through open doors into manor: An alarm sounds, summoning [Blood Thrall Guards].


# Shadow Hound
Tags: Beast, Shadow, Hunter

Dark as the night, reflecting no light, the Shadow Hound stands with a face dominated by a gaping maw and small, sinister red eyes. Its jaws could swallow a human head whole. Long and tall, yet unnervingly lean, it appears as if it has been grotesquely stretched.

Unless the characters are masquerading (e.g. undead scent or have vampiric blood), Shadow Hounds are hostile.
Bite: Deals 1 Wound on a hit. May target up to 2 foes in reach if snarling or lunging
Spiked Tongue (1/encounter):  Deals 1 Wound on a hit & Constriction: Target takes 1 automatic Wound each round until they escape or the tongue is severed.

# Garden of Roses
Tags: Garden, Blood, Roses, Ritual

A garden of deep crimson roses stretches ahead. The air is heavy with floral sweetness and iron. Thorns shimmer wetly in the light, and as you step closer, you hear a soft breathing from the vines.
Roses react to blood—blooming larger and more beautiful when fed.
Movement stirs the vines; they lash if not approached with care. Roll miraculous save or take a strike.
▶ Harvest a [Blood Rose]: avoid a 1 to pick safely or take a strike.
▶ Let the rose draw blood intentionally: gain favor with bloodbound entities (e.g. Shadow Hound, Blood Knight)


# Hat Room
Tags: Mirrors, Hats, Souls

The walls are adorned with hats of every shape, size, era, and realm, hanging solemnly from human-shaped hooks. Mirrors of myriad forms and dimensions are artfully scattered about, casting reflections from every angle. Among them, one mirror lies shattered, its fragments strewn across the floor like fallen stars.

▶ Inspect the mirrors: One polished mirror has arcane symbols which decoded read the name of the soul trapped in the [Mirrored Soul].
▶ Wear a Hat: 1-in-10 chance it’s somewhat magical and produces a small magic effect such as growing a beard, becoming smaller, taller, growing nails…


# Guest Room
A large, decorated wooden bed stands regally with its purple linen and silken pillows. A marble-topped dresser holds a silver mirror, adorned with a wig and scattered makeup. An ornate, old oak closet looms nearby. Bits of fine garments sticking out of the Dresser drawers.

▶ Check the closet:  In the closet are a small dead spider and two, somewhat rusty, metallic hangers.
▶ Inspect closet closely: Two small, thin apertures on both sides of the closet’s base. Inserting both hangers simultaneously opens a compartment containing a [magickal item].
▶ Check the dresser: DR1 or cut yourself on the dresser’s teeth, suffering 1 strike.  Examining every piece carefully uncovers a small [magickal item].


# Corridors

A stained red carpet, its colors fading and edges dirty, stretches across the floor. Paintings of various eras and styles adorn the walls, depicting both mundane and alien vistas. Life-like human statues in frightened poses are scattered throughout, frozen in eternal terror.
Blood flows through the walls;  pulsating as if alive.
Did the people in the paintings move?

# Dining Room

A long, ornate dinner table, grand enough to seat thirty-two guests. Suspended above, a massive golden chandelier (2  5) bathes the scene in flickering light. Platters and bowls (.5 1) are filled with freshly harvested human organs and limbs, each ghastly serving arranged with care and presentation.
Muffled screaming can be heard from the next room [Kitchen].
[Blood Servant]s enter and exit (replacing not so fresh dishes with new ones).

# Monstrous Doors

Sealed double doors, massive and warm to the touch, threaded with pulsing metallic-red veins. Stirs only at the presence of the unnatural—then parts, slow and breathing. 
Bite: 1 damage
Acidic blood: See Poison, Fire, Acid.
Spell immunity: Unaffected by sleep and charm spells.
Scream for help: After losing half hp, the doors call for reinforcements.
▶ Try to force them: causes eyes and a mouth to appear, questioning who they are and what they want. Without a convincing answer, the doors attack.
▶ Pass through: Enter into the Great Hall 

# Mirrored Soul

Trapped behind silver glass is a pale figure with the a familiar face—but softer, sadder. Its eyes flicker with fear and memory. It doesn’t speak unless spoken to, and even then, it looks away—as if ashamed to exist.
Engage: Roll a Presence Test (Target: 4+) to convince it to manifest. +Boon if you know their name. On success: it may reveal hidden knowledge, disrupt an enemy, or unlock a sealed path.

# Blood Servants

Human in appearance (blank eyes, unspeaking). Soaked clothes (fresh blood).
Ignore PCs unless attacked. Issue a high-pitched scream before fighting with their cleavers.
Cleaver: 1 strike damage

Bloodied table and drains (where people are vivisected and exsanguinated). Caged people (scared, wounded and disarmed). Stained metal table (Blood Extractor). Thick needles in a handle (for use on a bound victim). Full receptacle of blood (someone was recently drained). 
▶ Use the Blood Extractor on a Thrall: DR2+ breaks the Blood Thrall’s enthrallment.
▶ Use the Blood Extractor on a vampire: Draining a vampire enrages them but also temporarily disables their regeneration.

# Blood Prisoner

People of all kinds (varying ages and genders). Scared (wish to flee as fast as possible—maybe causing trouble). The things they have seen…
Engage, roll 1d6:
1.	Screams and tries to escape, potentially causing chaos.
2.	Paralyzed, unable to move or speak, needs coaxing.
3.	Pleads for help, shares horrific tales, seeks escort to safety.
4.	Hides, reacts with suspicion, slowly builds trust.
5.	Mistakes players for captors, potentially escalates tension.
6.	Overwhelmed, faints or falls, needs immediate aid.
