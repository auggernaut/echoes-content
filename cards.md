# Main Gate
Tags: Iron, Vines, Blood, Roses

A darkened, maw-shaped double gate of rusty iron, covered in vines, opens to a garden of decaying red roses embedded in blood, swaying without wind. A worn, stained black stone path, 8 feet wide, leads to the manor beyond. A tall vine fence extends from both sides of the gate into the night. Audible classical music emanates from the manor.

▶ [Blood Thrall]: Demand invitations to allow PCs entry. Attack if provoked or if the party gatecrashes.
▶ [Biting Gate]: The gate attacks unwelcome guests who approach.
▶ Look for another way in: the [Vine Fence] encircles the property, perhaps there’s another way in.


# Great Hall
Tags: Vampiric, Debauchery, Throne

Interior side of [Monstrous Doors] adorned with red metal veins, alive and pumping blood. They are flanked by two lines of columns, each decorated with scenes of vampiric debauchery, preying on all sorts of alien beings—and humans. At the end of the Hall is a Golden Throne shaped like skeletons and gold-plated.

▶ [Spiral Staircase] Winds up to the top floor from the corner of the room.
 
▶ Golden throne: touching it raises eyebrows; scraping gold off it takes time; destroying it reveals a ½ ton golden coffin (Kingly Wealth).


# Banshee Noble
Tags: Banshee, Unnatural

A striking spectral noblewoman with long, curling hair and sorrowful eyes. Her presence is regal and mournful. She wears shining jewelry that clings to memory like perfume on a ghost. One ring bears the crest of a forgotten house—a deep red rose.

Undead: Immune to effects that affect living creatures (e.g. poison). Immune to mind-affecting or mind-reading spells (e.g. charm, hold, sleep).
Wail (1/encounter): All nearby lose take 1 additional Bane on all rolls unless they retreat or comfort her.
Possessive Grief: If attacked, she disappears and haunts the aggressor until soothed or dispelled
Weakness: A hidden truth may change her attitude towards you. 

# Vine Fence
Tags: 

An imposing barbed fence towers twelve feet high, its rusty iron spikes lacquered with dried brown blood. Dark green vines wind their way through the barrier, their tendrils intertwining with the gruesome metal. 
▶ [Dark Vines] writhe as the heroes get closer. Climb over: they animate, attempting to impale intruders, draining their blood.
▶ Look for an opening: Broken and twisted metal shafts (as if melted) making a hole. Skeleton with charred bones nearby.
▶ Search the Skeleton: A pouch, a golden ring, scattered broken flasks, and 2 vials of [Holy Water].
▶ Shimmy through a Hole: Roll to beat DR2 or take 1 strike due to scraping against barbed wire.
