## ü©∏ The Situation

The Blood King ‚Äî a once-human monarch possessed by an alien parasite ‚Äî has summoned his ancient vampire vassals for a masked gathering under a bleeding moon. Tonight, he will ascend beyond undeath. The players are not invited guests. They've come seeking **Seleana Suantis**, a vampire hunter who vanished into the castle two years ago. Some say she still lives within, hunting the King from the shadows.

The castle pulses with alien life, its walls breathing with blood magic. The Blood King's heart beats somewhere within, and without it, he cannot be slain. But the castle is more than just a fortress ‚Äî it's a living entity that feeds on the memories and souls of those who enter.

## üé≠ ACT 1: The Blood Manor Approach

**The Main Gate** -  `[[Biting Gate]]` darkened, maw-shaped double gate of rusty iron, covered in vines, opens to a garden of decaying red roses embedded in blood, swaying without wind. A worn, stained black stone path, 8 feet wide, leads to the manor beyond. A tall vine fence extends from both sides of the gate into the night. Audible classical music emanates from the manor.

**Invitations Please** - Just inside the main gate stand two `[[Blood Thrall Guard]]` knights with glassy, distant eyes wearing tattered noble livery. These were once the Blood King's personal guards, transformed when the castle's magic corrupted them. They still wear their original uniforms but now serve the castle's will. When approached, they ask for invitations in a monotone voice, their eyes occasionally flickering with recognition when they see noble weapons or hear familiar names. One guard's hand twitches toward his sword when he sees a player's weapon - he remembers his former life as a knight.

**Another Way In** - A `[[Dark Vine Fence]]` encircles the property with thorns dripping blood or sap. A skeleton in tattered robes lies near a hole in the fence, clutching a vial of `[[Holy Water]]` and a journal. The skeleton belongs to a former vampire hunter who tried to infiltrate the castle months ago. His journal contains notes about the Blood King's weaknesses, the castle's layout, and a warning about the "heart chamber." The hole in the fence is a way in, but its jagged edges and writhing vines make passage treacherous.

**Inside the gate** - In the `[[Garden of Roses]]` blood-red flowers sway unnaturally, each pulsing with its own heartbeat. Each `[[Blood Rose]]` represents a memory consumed by the castle. Feeding them blood gains favor with bloodbound entities. `[[Shadow Hound]]` prowl between the rose bushes, their red eyes glowing as they patrol for intruders. The hounds' dark forms blend with the shadows, making them difficult to spot until they're nearly upon you.

## üé≠ ACT 2: Exploring the Manor

The manor's interior is a living, breathing entity. Thick veins pulse visibly beneath the wallpaper, carrying dark viscous blood through the structure itself. The carpets have an unsettling, tongue-like texture that seems to twitch underfoot. Tiny blind eyes dot the walls at irregular intervals, unseeing yet ever-present. Ornate rose motifs‚Äîthe Blood King's family crest‚Äîare carved into every archway and corner, their petals stained a deep crimson.

The walls themselves are surprisingly resilient. Breaking through requires significant force (2 strikes), and doing so causes the wounded section to emit an otherworldly scream as black blood oozes from the breach. Such violations of the manor's flesh draw immediate attention, manifesting a random threat from elsewhere in the castle (GM draws a Threat card).

Let players explore these areas in any order they choose. When 3-4 Vampire Guests have gathered in the manor (track using `[[Vampire Guest]]` cards), transition to Act 3.

**Entering the Manor** - `[[Guilded Entry Hall]]` golden surfaces reflect flickering torchlight. A massive dwarven statue stands guard with stone eyes that follow movement. This statue depicts King Aldric's first advisor, who helped him build the castle before the alien parasite took hold. The statue's outstretched hand expects an invitation letter from the Blood King. The coat rack holds masquerade disguises left by previous guests, including a particularly fine bat-shaped pin that belonged to Lord Blackwood, a noble who attended the last masquerade but never left the castle. Lord Blackwood is now one of the Blood Thrall Guards. If an alarm is triggered, `[[Blood Thrall Guards]]` from outside the manor will rush in to investigate.

**Seleana Suantis** - Inside `[[Trapped Lair]]` you'll find maps of the castle scratched into the walls. She's rigged the room with traps, making it dangerous but defensible.  Once a legendary `[[Vampire Hunter]]`, now gaunt and scarred but unbroken. Her eyes still burn with determination despite months of captivity. She wears tattered hunter's garb beneath the prisoner's rags, and a silver medallion of the Hunter's Guild hangs defiantly around her neck.

When found, she is:
- Immediately hostile until she realizes the players are not vampires
- Eager to share critical intelligence about the castle's defenses
- Concerned about other prisoners she's befriended
- Ready to join the fight if freed, though requiring time to recover

What She Knows:
- The Blood King's heart is hidden somewhere within the castle
- The castle's magic corrupts those who stay too long
- The castle's living walls can be temporarily paralyzed with holy water
- Several secret passages she discovered during her infiltration

If Freed:
- Can serve as a guide through the castle's layout
- Knows safe routes to avoid patrols
- Has a hidden cache of weapons in the kitchen cellars
- Will insist on rescuing other prisoners before confronting the King

**The Living Corridors** - A single circular `[[Living Corridors]]` forms the manor's primary artery, with individual chambers arranged along its outer edge like pearls on a necklace. This ring-like design ensures guests can never truly reach a dead end‚Äîthough whether this is a mercy or a curse remains to be seen.

When players traverse the corridors, roll 1d6 to determine what they encounter:
- 1d4 `[[Vampire Guest]]`s wandering lost, complaining about the formality while seeking the `[[Dining Room]]`
- A `[[Sweeping Darkness]]` moving through the halls
- A `[[Living Blood]]` mass crawling across the ceiling, searching for fresh blood
- A wailing `[[Ghost of Torment]]` drifting past
- 1d4 `[[Blood Thrall]]` guards dragging a bound and gagged human prisoner to be drained

**The King's Better Half** - The `[[Hat Room]]` is filled with elaborate masks and headpieces arranged before tall mirrors. Among them stands an ornate silver mirror, its surface rippling like water. The `[[Mirrored Soul]]` of Alvaraz dwells within - birthed when the Blood King stripped his weakness and mortal soul's fragment for imprisionment in the mirror. The Blood King fears and hates this mirror-bound aspect of his former self - if Alvaraz agrees to confront the King, the King must make a saving throw each round to take any action, paralyzed by the sight of his lost humanity. 

**The Guest Quarters** - `[[Guest Room]]` A lavishly decorated chamber with heavy velvet curtains and a four-poster bed. The room is unnaturally cold, and a silver mirror on the dresser occasionally ripples like water. Here, Lenice, the `[[Banshee Mother]]`, retreats to mourn. A portrait showing a young noble with kind eyes (the Blood King before transformation) sits on the dresser. 

When players enter, she materializes by the window, speaking in a hollow voice:
- "My Aldric loved this view. He would sit here for hours, studying his books..."
- "The King took him from me. Corrupted my boy with those cursed tomes from the eastern lands."
- "I hear Aldric sometimes, crying out in the night. But when I search, I find only the King's servants."

If players ask about Aldric's childhood, she shares specific memories:
- "He was such a gentle child. He'd rescue injured birds, nurse them in this very room."
- "On his 16th birthday, he swore to find a way to keep me alive forever. I was ill then..."
- "The last time I saw him, he was carrying that black book. The one with the silver clasp." (GM Note: This book can be found in the King's Hall)

**The Kitchen of Horrors** - `[[Kitchen]]` contains the Blood Extractor and caged Blood Prisoners. Kitchen staff work tirelessly preparing "meals" for guests. Former servants transformed by castle magic, some remember their humanity and may help players who show kindness. `[[Blood Prisoner]]` (1-2 cards) some are former hunters like Seleana, others are nobles who opposed the Blood King. One prisoner might be a former courtier who knows the location of the King's heart. Another could be a mage who understands how to break the castle's enchantments.

## üé≠ ACT 3: The Blood Hunt

**The Hunt Begins** - The Blood King's voice echoes through the manor: "My dear guests, we have uninvited visitors. The first to bring me their heads shall receive a special gift." The `[[Vampire Guest]]` cards drawn earlier now become hostile hunters, stalking the halls in search of the players. Each guest retains their personality but now views the players as prey.

**Return to Familiar Ground** - Players may need to revisit previously explored areas, but the hunt changes their dynamics:
- The `[[Living Corridors]]` now pulse faster, the eyes on the walls tracking movement
- The `[[Hat Room]]` mirrors may provide emergency escape routes
- The `[[Kitchen]]` staff might hide sympathetic players
- The `[[Guest Room]]` could serve as a temporary sanctuary


**The Hunting Guests** - When encountering a `[[Vampire Guest]]`, roll to determine their approach:
1. Direct confrontation, announcing their presence
2. Stealthy stalking, waiting for the perfect moment
3. Attempting to separate the group
4. Setting up an ambush in a nearby room
5. Offering false alliance before betrayal
6. Pursuing with single-minded fury

Each guest remembers their interactions from Act 2, which may affect their hunting style. Some might hesitate if players forged strong connections earlier.

## üé≠ ACT 4: The Final Confrontation

**The Path Upward** - Players can reach the upper floor through:
- The `[[Spiral Staircase]]` in the Great Hall - a grand but exposed route, where vampire nobles gather
- The hidden Service Stairs behind the `[[Kitchen]]` - narrow but secretive, used by `[[Blood Servants]]`

**The King's Hall** - A grand chamber lined with portraits of the Blood King's transformation. Each painting shows him growing less human. The black book with the silver clasp mentioned by Lenice rests on a pedestal, but touching it alerts the King. Ancient texts about parasitic entities lie scattered across tables.

**The Princesses' Study** - A dust-covered room frozen in time. Three small desks face a larger one - the Blood King's daughters' classroom before they vanished. Their journals reveal the King's gradual change and their growing fear. A music box plays their mother's lullaby when opened.

**The King's Chambers** - Heavy curtains block all light. A massive bed with iron restraints suggests the King's struggle with his transformation. A hidden compartment contains letters to Lenice, showing his desperate attempts to resist the parasite. `[[Vampire Guest]]` cards are more likely to be drawn here.

### **The Final Battle**
**The King's Weakness** - Players may have discovered:
- His imprisoned soul in the `[[Mirrored Soul]]` of Alvaraz
- The location of his hidden heart (revealed by freed `[[Blood Prisoner]]`)
- Lenice's knowledge of his transformation from the `[[Guest Room]]`
- The true nature of his "tributes" from Seleana's research

**The Blood King Responds** - When players breach the upper floor:
- "More uninvited guests? How... delicious. My nobles grow hungry."
- "That weak thing in the mirror? A remnant I shed long ago."
- "Poor Lenice. Still clinging to who I was, not what I've become."
- "Your blood will make a fine tribute to mark this evening."

**The King's Tactics:**
1. Commands his noble guests to hunt the intruders
2. Uses `[[Shadow Hound]]` to corner and separate the group
3. Orders the `[[Blood Thrall Guard]]` to block escape routes
4. If confronted with Alvaraz, must save vs paralysis each round
5. When wounded, retreats to his private chambers

**The King's Chamber** - A grand room atop the manor where:
- Blood-red tapestries depict his rise to power
- His heart rests in an ornate reliquary
- Noble vampires gather to pay tribute
- The `[[Garden of Roses]]` below responds to his moods
