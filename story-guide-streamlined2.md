# STORY GUIDE: The Banshee's Court

*A gothic horror one-shot for 3–5 players using the Castle Deck.*

---

## 🩸 The Situation

Lenice Albathea was once a mortal noblewoman who ruled these lands with an iron fist. When her husband died, she made a pact with dark forces to preserve her beauty and power forever. Now she rules as the Banshee Queen, a spectral tyrant who feeds on the suffering of her subjects. Tonight, she hosts her annual "Gathering of Sorrows" — a masquerade where the living are invited to become permanent guests in her eternal court. The players have been summoned, but they don't know why.
