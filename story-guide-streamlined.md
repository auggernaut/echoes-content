# STORY GUIDE: The Crimson Masquerade

*A gothic infiltration one-shot for 3–5 players using the Castle Deck.*

## 🩸 The Situation

The Blood King — a once-human monarch possessed by an alien parasite — has summoned his ancient vampire vassals for a masked gathering under a bleeding moon. Tonight, he will ascend beyond undeath. The players are not invited guests. They've come seeking **Seleana Suantis**, a vampire hunter who vanished into the castle two years ago. Some say she still lives within, hunting the King from the shadows.
