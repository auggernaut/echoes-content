# Cargo Hold - Location Cards

## How to Use This System

When players enter the Cargo Hold, present the Card Front first to establish the normal layout and key features. Then draw one scenario card to set the current state and tone. Each scenario card provides details and prompts that evolve the scene based on player actions.

## Card Front: Cargo Hold (Normal)

Long rectangular freight bay (double-height, crane rails overhead). Container stacks form aisles (painted loading lanes, tie‑down rings on deck). Cargo nets sway gently (catwalks and mesh walkways above). Control kiosk by dock doors (blinking status lights). Floor and gantry crane (hook, rail, lifting points). Twin dock doors (recessed maintenance access nearby).

## Card 1: Abandoned

**Atmosphere:** Vast, Shadowed, Suspended

**Intro Description:**
The cargo bay lies still under dim work lights. Dust hangs in the air, and the ship’s slow groan makes the cargo nets sway a fraction. Stacks of containers loom in uneven rows; a handcart rests at an odd angle, and something somewhere ticks as it cools. The air is faintly warm, carrying traces of metal, oil, and a recent presence.

**Details:**
• check handcart tray: a half-eaten meal tin sits in its rack, steam still clinging to the rim
• search beneath handcart: a dropped keycard lies half-hidden by a wheel, smeared with dust
• follow footprints: overlapping tracks—some small, some heavy—converge toward the dock doors
• examine stacked crates: fresh scrapes mar edges where something forced a way through
• check wall console: an aborted evacuation order hangs, timer frozen mid-countdown
• inspect repacked crates: careless reseals and a torn cargo net trail into a side aisle

**Story Seeds:**
• What emergency caused everyone to leave so quickly?
• Where did the crew go in such a hurry?
• What were they trying to save or hide?

## Card 2: Something Stirs

**Atmosphere:** Vast, Shadowed, Suspended

**Intro Description:**
Pale light jitters across steel, turning angles strange for a heartbeat at a time. The rafters disappear into darkness above the web of nets, and the maze of crates narrows and widens unpredictably. Every small sound seems to travel—a faint scuff, a brush of fabric—before the bay settles again into held breath.

**Details:**
• climb catwalk: a scuffed bootprint on the grate ends abruptly at a maintenance hatch
• inspect leaking seam: viscous fluid weeps; ripples form when the light steadies
• watch crate surface: condensation blooms briefly, as if from a warm breath
• survey layout: fresh drag marks create a blind corner and break lines of sight
• time the lamp: during steady light, something shifts in the rafters; during flicker, it freezes
• listen: a soft metal-on-metal click repeats from two aisles, then falls silent

**Story Seeds:**
• Who or what is hiding in the cargo hold?
• Are they friend or foe?
• What do they want from the players?

## Card 3: Contraband

**Atmosphere:** Vast, Shadowed, Suspended

**Intro Description:**
Order lives here in subtle ways. Certain stacks sit too neat, corners aligned with a surveyor’s care; other pallets are spaced just so, forming tidy aisles through the gloom. Fresh sealant gleams on a few lids under the lamp’s glow, and mismatched stencils peek through newer paint. A sweet, unfamiliar note lingers beneath the usual cargo smells.

**Details:**
• open false panel: hidden luxury goods, unregistered tools, and compact weapons spill from cavities
• review manifest: edits are obvious; original entries ghost beneath newer text
• decode labels: foreign-script routing codes don’t exist on ship charts
• check cargo kiosk scales: a specific series of crates reads consistently underweight
• examine seals: cuts are heat-welded; weld pattern matches handheld sealers
• watch kiosk telemetry: a faint ping every thirty seconds reveals an active tracker in a crate

**Story Seeds:**
• Who was smuggling this contraband?
• What are the consequences of discovering it?
• Who else knows about this illegal cargo?

## Card 4: Battle Damage

**Atmosphere:** Vast, Shadowed, Suspended

**Intro Description:**
Red emergency strips paint long bands across the deck, turning steel into silhouettes. Heat has kissed some surfaces to a dull sheen; the air carries a bitter tang that catches at the back of the throat. Netting hangs slack in places, and fine grit crunches underfoot as the bay hums with tired systems.

**Details:**
• inspect crane hook and rail: heat pitting and a scored hook show a dried spray pattern
• trace impact paths: scar arcs curve toward cover behind stacked crates
• read blast residue: soot fans show a directional blast; ricochets ladder a support pillar
• inspect catwalk support: stress scoring and crystallized residue trace along the brace seam
• sift lane: spent casings and fused slag pepper the deck; discharge tang lingers
• query emergency panel: a partial alert —“…containment…”— loops before resetting

**Story Seeds:**
• What was the battle about?
• Who were the combatants?
• What were they fighting over?

## Card 5: Personal Tragedy

**Atmosphere:** Vast, Shadowed, Suspended

**Intro Description:**
Amid the metal and polymer, softer textures interrupt the eye—cloth edges, paper corners, a ribbon of color tucked between crates. The bay is quiet, and the temperature feels a touch warmer than the corridors outside. A mild scent of stored fabric and old perfume lingers beneath oil and ozone.

**Details:**
• look at wall: crew photos and children’s drawings, edges frayed, are taped at eye level
• check music player: a silent loop plays; the red battery icon blinks
• open locker: luxury rations and comfort items are labeled with first names among parts
• inspect ring: a wedding band hangs on twine; a note reads, “Hold this for me.”
• read ledger: carton sides track “owed” and “repaid” in careful tally marks
• search blanket-nest: a small lockbox sits hidden between pallets, faintly warm

**Story Seeds:**
• Who smuggled these personal items?
• What drove them to such desperate measures?
• What happened to their families?

## Card 6: Alien Cargo

**Atmosphere:** Vast, Shadowed, Suspended

**Intro Description:**
A low vibration threads the air, almost below hearing, and the deck seems to notice first. Indicator lights on a handful of containers pulse in off-rhythms, casting odd hues across the bay’s ribs. The air feels cooler here, with a clean metallic bite that doesn’t quite match the rest of the ship.

**Details:**
• touch seam: a translucent film clings, then retracts from the light when disturbed
• examine rations: crystalline growths refract oddly inside a cracked crate
• listen/feel: low-frequency pulses vibrate in your teeth more than your ears
• compare cycles: the deck’s rhythm is a fraction off from ship cycles
• test resin: unfamiliar reseal resin cures glass-clear with an ozone scent
• photograph markings: arrangements alter between shots; images don’t match memory

**Story Seeds:**
• What is inside the alien containers?
• Where did this cargo come from?
• What are the consequences of opening them?

## Card 7: Mechanical Failure

**Atmosphere:** Vast, Shadowed, Suspended

**Intro Description:**
Lighting stutters in uneven cycles, washing the cargo maze from red to shadow and back again. Somewhere a fan ramps, falters, and tries again; the floor carries a faint tremor like a distant engine misfiring. The air is hot and dry, tinged with the smell of tired electronics.

**Details:**
• open service panel by conduit: two breakers sit half-thrown, tagged with grease-pencil notes
• test lane: gravity plates hum irregularly; loose bolts creep when unattended
• inspect fractures: crate corners spidered from sudden weight shifts
• feel housing: heat shimmer skates above a motor; a fan rattles, then seizes
• read console: cascading faults suggest a reroute; confirmation is pending
• examine stack: a slumped lean and sawed tie-down grooves mark slow failure

**Story Seeds:**
• What caused the mechanical failures?
• Are the systems still unstable?
• What other parts of the ship might be affected?

## Card 8: Hidden Survivors

**Atmosphere:** Vast, Shadowed, Suspended

**Intro Description:**
Paths seem to exist where none were planned—clearings between pallets, a stool tucked where it can catch a bit of light, a bottle cap glinting under a crate. The air holds a lived-in warmth, and the quiet is the kind that listens back. Every now and then, a soft tap sounds, then chooses not to repeat.

**Details:**
• open crate wall: a quiet hinge reveals a narrow sleeping nook
• inventory nook: blankets, a chipped mug, and a folded jumpsuit are arranged with care
• follow signs: water rings and crumb trails lead from a tucked stool to a shadowed gap
• call out loudly: three soft knocks answer once, then fade to silence
• spot tripline: thin cord with tin caps crosses a side passage at shin height
• lift deck grate: a small stash of meds and patches rests by warm ducting

**Story Seeds:**
• Who is hiding in the cargo hold?
• Why are they hiding?
• Are they friend or foe?

## Card 9: Time Capsule

**Atmosphere:** Vast, Shadowed, Suspended

**Intro Description:**
Dust hangs under the beams like a thin veil, and old labels peel at the corners of long-ignored crates. The bay smells dry and still, like a room kept shut too long. The lights hum steadily here, as if careful not to disturb whatever time has decided to leave untouched.

**Details:**
• review manifest: defunct corp sigils and retired trade routes fill the pages
• inspect seals: wax and lead crimps bear dates that don’t match modern calendars
• handle tools: weighty alloys and braided cables use obsolete color standards
• open cases: datafilm spools and etched plates ride in cold shock cases
• read stasis: tired amber indicators and a low hum keep the air oddly crisp
• study dust: curved arcs suggest careful hands returned years apart

**Story Seeds:**
• What secrets does this ancient cargo hold?
• Why was it preserved for so long?
• What can it tell us about the past?

## Card 10: Chaos Manifest

**Atmosphere:** Vast, Shadowed, Suspended

**Intro Description:**
The light wavers—not brighter or dimmer, just unsure—and shadows feel heavier than they should beneath the nets. Distances seem a touch off across the rows of crates, as if the far end of the bay takes a step back when you look away. A metallic-sweet note rides the air, hard to name and easy to notice.

**Details:**
• clap and listen: echoes arrive a breath early, then return from the wrong direction
• watch seam: a fluid bead climbs the crate corner against gravity, pauses, then beads again
• reread label: ration ingredients change between readings seconds apart
• watch stencils: container markings reorder between blinks into almost-words
• freeze frame: when light steadies, shadows slip a hand’s width from their sources
• check chronos: wrist timers drift out of sync inside, then snap back at the threshold

**Story Seeds:**
• What is happening to reality in this place?
• Are the players seeing things that shouldn't exist?
• What happens if they stay too long?
