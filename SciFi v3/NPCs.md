## NPCs

### 1. Dr. Elara Voss (Scientist Archetype)

#### Variation 1: Obsessed Researcher
- **Condition**: Manic and sleep-deprived, hyper-focused on analyzing a mysterious anomaly or threat in a lab-like room (e.g., science lab or med bay), surrounded by flickering monitors and scattered data pads.
- **Motive**: Driven to unlock the secrets of the ship's current crisis for knowledge or innovation, reluctant to resolve it quickly unless it poses an immediate existential risk.
- **Abilities**:
  - **Data Analysis**: Decodes patterns in the ship's anomaly (e.g., energy surges or alien signals), providing players with a hazard map or clue if persuaded (requires traded resources or a persuasion check).
  - **Trap Setter**: Sets up non-lethal defenses (e.g., electric fields or sensor alarms) in her room to ward off interruptions, requiring dexterity or tech checks to bypass.
  - **Resource Hoarder**: Controls multiple key items (e.g., components or data files) and may trade one for assistance in her studies, tempting players to vie for exclusive access.
- **Impact**: Fosters cooperation for shared insights but ignites competition over her hoarded resources in high-stakes scenarios.

#### Variation 2: Traumatized Survivor
- **Condition**: Shell-shocked from a recent incident tied to the ship's peril, hiding in a secure area (e.g., med bay or crew quarters) with trembling hands and improvised barricades.

- **Abilities**:
  - **Medical Expertise**: Treats injuries or provides buffs (e.g., health kits or temporary resistance to hazards), but demands essential supplies (e.g., oxygen or tools) in exchange.
  - **Crisis Knowledge**: Shares a method to mitigate a ship-wide threat (e.g., stabilizing systems or countering intrusions) for one round, but requires group protection to execute it.
  - **Panic Response**: Locks down her room if threatened, blocking access to vital resources until calmed via persuasion or a show of trust.
- **Impact**: Encourages teamwork for mutual protection but tempts players to exploit her vulnerability for personal gain in survival-focused scenarios.

- **Condition**: Calm and calculating, positioned near a central threat or resource hub (e.g., cargo bay or bridge), equipped with protective gear to navigate dangers unscathed.
- **Motive**: Seeks personal gain from the crisis (e.g., profit, power, or leverage), treating players as potential partners or rivals in her schemes.
- **Abilities**:
  - **Tech Sabotage**: Neutralizes a hazard in one room (e.g., drones or environmental dangers) but only for players who concede something valuable (e.g., a resource or favor).
  - **Deceptive Charms**: Influences a player to disrupt the group (e.g., via misinformation or minor betrayal) through a challenging persuasion mechanic.
  - **Protective Device**: Uses a gadget to create a safe zone in her area, offering refuge for a cost (e.g., resources or an alliance), which could exclude others.
- **Impact**: Sparks competition through one-sided deals but demands cooperation to leverage her skills in intrigue-heavy scenarios.

### 2. Chief Engineer Marko (Mechanic Archetype)

#### Variation 1: Gruff Loyalist
- **Condition**: Overworked and battered from ongoing repairs, stationed in a high-risk mechanical area (e.g., engine room or armory) with bandaged wounds and scattered tools.
- **Motive**: Committed to preserving the ship and its occupants, focusing on fixes to extend survival time, but reliant on external help to succeed.
- **Abilities**:
  - **Repair Expertise**: Mends a vital system (e.g., power grid or escape mechanisms), easing group penalties (e.g., timer reductions) if supplied with necessary items.
  - **Hazard Navigation**: Guides players through dangerous paths in his domain (e.g., avoiding leaks or traps), benefiting helpers while hindering solo actors.
  - **Emergency Broadcast**: Alerts the ship to a player's actions or position, potentially revealing betrayals or coordinating group efforts.

#### Variation 2: Desperate Survivor
- **Condition**: Exhausted and isolated in a personal space (e.g., crew quarters or mess hall), gripping a tool like a wrench amid environmental chaos.
- **Motive**: Centered on self-preservation, trading skills or info for assurances of safety, with little trust in others unless proven.
- **Abilities**:
  - **Jury-Rig**: Crafts improvised devices (e.g., hazard counters or shortcuts) from nearby junk, but requires payment in survival essentials.
  - **Defensive Tactics**: Sets traps in a room to impede pursuers or rivals, gaining a personal advantage in movement or resource access.
  - **Mechanical Insight**: Reveals a hidden route or weakness in the ship's threats, sharing it selectively to spark rivalries.
- **Impact**: Drives competition for his exclusive insights but necessitates cooperation to obtain his crafted aids in resource-scarce scenarios.

- **Condition**: Defiant and inventive, working in a gadget-filled zone (e.g., armory or comms room) with repurposed tech and a spark of determination.
- **Motive**: Aims to assert dominance or innovation amid the crisis, using it as a chance to showcase and expand his influence.
- **Abilities**:
  - **Drone Control**: Repurposes automated threats (e.g., security bots) to assist players, lowering challenges if compensated with materials.
  - **Sabotage Expertise**: Disarms or reroutes room securities, but with a hidden risk of backfiring on non-allies.

### 3. Rogue AI Vex (AI Archetype)

#### Variation 1: Glitching Guardian

## Notes on Integration
- **Generalization**: Conditions, motives, and abilities are now scenario-agnostic (e.g., referencing "anomaly," "crisis," or "threat" instead of specifics like "relic"), allowing easy swaps into infestations, sabotages, or escapes while keeping archetypal essence.
- **Detail Level**: Retained engaging specifics (e.g., "flickering monitors," "jury-rig from junk") for vividness and roleplay potential, without over-specifying to one plot.
- **Cooperative-Competitive Balance**: NPCs blend group benefits (e.g., maps, repairs) with individual temptations (e.g., trades, betrayals), adaptable to any 10-room setup or player count.

Would you like me to expand on how these fit a new scenario, add more variations, or integrate them with specific rooms/items/events?
