Here’s a recap of the GM instructions we drafted as we built the framework for Echoes of Expanse.
They were split into Scenario setup and how to use Location/Event cards during play.

⸻

🎲 Starting a Game (Scenario Setup)
	1.	Draw a Scenario Card (or choose one).
	•	Read aloud the Hook to frame the situation.
	•	Share the Objectives, Complication, and Failure Consequence with the players.
	2.	Add Seeded Events.
	•	Shuffle the listed Event cards into the Event deck.
	•	This ensures the session hits key beats related to the Scenario.
	3.	Ask Prompts.
	•	Use the Scenario’s questions to tie the players in.
	•	Example (Host to the Hunger): “Who insists the host must be saved, no matter the risk?”
	4.	Build Characters.
	•	Players choose a class.
	•	Draw 5 Threads cards, keep 2 of different types (Bond, Quirk, Drive).
	•	Each player now has a core class card, Threads, and 2–3 class cards from their deck.
	5.	Lay Out the Map.
	•	Pick a ship map (e.g. Derelict).
	•	Place it in the middle of the table.
	•	Each room number corresponds to a Location Card, drawn at random or chosen by the GM.

📍 Using Location Cards
	•	When players enter a room, read the “Stuff Players See” description (with bold keywords for quick skimming).
	•	If they investigate or linger, reveal one or more Optional Details.
	•	You can foreshadow by dropping an Optional Detail even if they don’t explicitly search.

⸻

⚠️ Using Event Cards
	•	When tension rises or the group enters a new Location, draw an Event Card.
	•	Match its type to the fiction:
	•	Threat → creature/foe shows up.
	•	Hazard → environmental danger.
	•	Phenomenon → strange/weird occurrence.
	•	NPC → survivor, rival, or AI.
	•	Read the flavor + description aloud, then apply the Special rules.
	•	Use Optional Details to make the encounter stranger, creepier, or more personal.

⸻

🧭 Pacing & Flow
	•	Don’t prep a script. Let the Scenario’s Objectives + Complication guide play.
	•	Escalate pressure every 2–3 rooms by adding a Hazard or Phenomenon Event.
	•	Mix certainty and weirdness. Locations provide grounded detail; Events provide chaos and horror.
	•	Endgame: Bring in the Failure Consequence if time is running short or the group stalls. Otherwise, let the crew resolve their Objectives through play.
