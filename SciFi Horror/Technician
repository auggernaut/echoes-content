🎴 Technician Deck (10 Cards)

⸻

Technician
Core Class Card

Health: 3 Strikes

Defenses
- When a Strike would hit you, roll a d6. On a 5+, you avoid it by ducking into cover or shutting a door at the last second.
- When technology explodes or malfunctions, roll a d6. On a 6, it hurts someone else instead of you.

Boons
- Systems Savant: When repairing, hacking, or bypassing tech, roll +1d6 and keep the highest.
- Rigged to Work: Once per session, declare a broken system still functions one more time before failing.

⸻

Bypass
Ability
Clever, Quick

Once per scene, you may unlock, disable, or reroute one system (doors, alarms, locks) without rolling.

“Every system has a back door. I just need to find it.”
	•	What tool do I always use, no matter how inappropriate?
	•	Who taught me my first hack?

⸻

Stabilize Reactor
Ability
Risky, Vital

Once per session, roll a d6. On a 4+, you stabilize a failing system (reactor, engine, life support). On a 1, it worsens dramatically.

“I can keep it together — until I can’t.”
	•	What scar reminds me of the last time I failed?
	•	Who do I work harder for when things go wrong?

⸻

Hot‑Wire
Ability
Improvised, Bold

Once per fight, you may jury‑rig a device or weapon to function in an unintended way. Gain advantage on that roll, then the device breaks.

“Don’t worry, I’ve done this before.”
	•	What’s the stupidest thing I’ve ever hot‑wired?
	•	Who never trusts me with their gear?

⸻

Failsafe Override
Ability
Cautious, Dangerous

Once per session, you can force a system to keep running one more time before total failure.

“Push it past the red, and pray.”
	•	What system did I keep alive longer than it should have lasted?
	•	What part of me still aches from that day?

⸻

Corporate Training
Background
Efficient, Jaded

Once per session, declare you know the specifications of this ship or device. The GM must reveal a useful fact.

“I know this model inside and out. That’s why I hate it.”
	•	What company trained me?
	•	Why did I walk away from them?

⸻

Burned Out Engineer
Background
Cynical, Overworked

Once per session, reroll a failed repair or hack — but if you fail again, the system catastrophically shorts out.

“I’ve seen too many systems die in my hands.”
	•	Who still blames me for a disaster?
	•	What system do I secretly hope will fail?

⸻

Multitool
Item
Compact, Essential

A folding all‑purpose tool with sparks and solder.

Once per room, reroll a failed repair.

“This tool has fixed more ships than their whole damn crew.”
	•	Who gave me this tool?
	•	What’s etched on its handle?

⸻

Drone Companion
Item
Loyal, Fragile

A small hovering maintenance drone.

Once per scene, send the drone to scout ahead or deliver a small item. On a roll of 1, it is destroyed.

“They say it’s just a drone. I say it’s my only friend.”
	•	What nickname do I call it by?
	•	What part of me does it remind me of?

⸻

Data Pad
Item
Portable, Flickering

A cracked pad that still connects to half the ship’s systems.

Once per session, ask the GM one question about ship logs or systems; they must answer.

“If it’s in the system, I can find it.”
	•	What password do I always use?
	•	What file do I never open again?

⸻

Patch Job
Ability
Improvised, Desperate

Once per scene, restore 1 temporary Hit to an ally by cobbling together a brace, patch, or rig.

“Hold still. This’ll work… for now.”
	•	Who do I patch up the most?
	•	Who told me I should stop trying to fix everything?
