Alright — here’s a draft structure and content for an 8–10 page Player’s Guide for Echoes.
It expands the 2‑page reference into a full booklet: more examples, tone pieces, and flavor to immerse players while still keeping the EZD6‑style rules light.

📖 Echoes — Player’s Guide

⸻

Page 1: Welcome to Echoes
	•	Tone text: “The lights flicker. The ship groans. Something moves where no one should be.”
	•	What is Echoes? → A fast, card‑driven sci‑fi horror RPG of survival, weirdness, and discovery.
	•	What makes it different → No character sheets, minimal prep, story emerges from cards.
	•	What you need to play → A deck of cards (Locations, Events, Items, Threads, Scenarios, Classes), d6 dice, tokens for Strikes/Karma, and a ship map.

⸻

Page 2: Core Loop of Play

Explore
	•	Move to a new Location on the map. GM reveals its description.

Reveal
	•	GM may draw an Event card — threat, hazard, phenomenon, NPC.

React
	•	Players act: roll dice, use Abilities, play Items, roleplay Threads.

Survive
	•	Strikes measure health. Karma fuels luck. When the ship pushes back, spend resources or get creative.

Example of Play Snippet:
	•	“The Scavenger ducks into the Cargo Hold. GM reads aloud crates swaying in the dim light. The player asks to search. GM draws Event: Ferals Awake. Suddenly, pale scavengers drop from the vents. Dice roll. Screams follow.”

⸻

Page 3: Dice & Resolution
	•	Actions are risky? Roll 1d6 vs TN (4 = standard, 5–6 = hard, 2–3 = easy).
	•	1 = failure + complication.
	•	6 = success + bonus, explode for more.
	•	Add +1d6 advantage if your Boon applies. Keep the highest.
	•	EZD6 spirit = GM sets TN on the fly.

Examples:
	•	Cutting torch open a door → TN 4.
	•	Leaping across a collapsing catwalk → TN 5.
	•	Shooting into melee with risk of friendly fire → TN 6.

⸻

Page 4: Strikes & Survival
	•	Strikes = health. When you run out, you’re down (dead, broken, or echo).
	•	Typical Health: Soldier 4, Scavenger 3, Technician 3, Mystic 3, Echoed 2.
	•	Defenses give you ways to roll to ignore damage.

Armor Example: Soldier’s Combat Armor ignores damage on 4+.
Mystic Example: Faith’s Shield ignores psychic harm on 4+.
Echoed Example: Unreal Form ignores any attack on 5+, but fragile.

⸻

Page 5: Karma
	•	Start with 3.
	•	Gain when: you roleplay Threads (Bonds, Quirks, Drives), or fail dramatically.
	•	Spend to: reroll, avoid a complication, power certain abilities.

Threads integration:
	•	Bond → “I swore to protect you.” Gain Karma if you bleed for them.
	•	Quirk → “I can’t leave without a trinket.” Gain Karma if you risk safety for loot.
	•	Drive → “I need to know.” Gain Karma if you open the door that should stay closed.

⸻

Page 6: Building Your Character
	1.	Pick a Class (Soldier, Scavenger, Technician, Mystic, Echoed).
	2.	Take your Health (fixed per class).
	3.	Pick 1 Defense card (how you survive).
	4.	Pick 1 Boon card (what you excel at).
	5.	Draw 2–3 Class cards (Abilities, Backgrounds, Items).
	6.	Draw 2 Threads cards (from 5, must be different types).

Example Build:
	•	Soldier with Reactive Dodge + Melee Specialist, plus Abilities Heavy Strike and Armor Training. Threads: Old Rivalry and Greed.
	•	Result = agile bruiser obsessed with loot and outshining another PC.

⸻

Page 7: Card Types in Detail
	•	Location: Where you are. Always with optional details.
	•	Event: Threat, Hazard, Phenomenon, or NPC. Pushes story forward.
	•	Item: Gear, weapons, weird artifacts.
	•	Class: Abilities, Backgrounds, Signature Items.
	•	Threads: Bonds, Quirks, Drives. Roleplay these to earn Karma.
	•	Scenario: The mission — objectives, complications, failure conditions.

⸻

Page 8: Taking Action & Combat
	•	Narration first: describe what you do.
	•	If risky → roll 1d6 vs TN. Apply Boon/Ability/Item as needed.
	•	Combat uses the same system: no separate mechanics.
	•	Attacks → TN 4 if in range/feasible, harder if conditions are bad.
	•	Damage → 1 Strike on success, unless weapon/ability says otherwise.

EZD6 style: Monsters don’t roll — they just inflict Strikes unless stopped.

⸻

Page 9: Advancement & Between Sessions
	•	Not a campaign‑heavy game, but you can track Threads across sessions.
	•	At the end of a session:
	•	Did I risk something for my Drive?
	•	Did I deepen/test a Bond?
	•	Did I let a Quirk cause trouble?
	•	For each “yes,” gain +1 Karma at start of next session.
	•	Optional: swap one card between sessions to reflect growth.

⸻

Page 10: Survival Advice
	•	Don’t hoard Karma → spend it to survive.
	•	Threads drive play → lean into them for rewards.
	•	Work as a team → cover weaknesses.
	•	Not every fight is winnable. Running is survival.
	•	Weirdness is part of the ship → let it shape your character.

⸻

✅ This structure gives you a full 10‑page booklet that:
	•	Explains rules in plain language.
	•	Sprinkles in example snippets and prompts.
	•	Expands character creation and card types.
	•	Sets tone for play (sci‑fi horror, narrative, survival).

👉 Do you want me to flesh this into polished, page‑ready text (like a booklet draft), or keep it as an outline so you can rearrange sections first?
