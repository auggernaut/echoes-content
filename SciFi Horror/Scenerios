Prompts:
	•	What personal memory bleeds into the ship’s dream?
	•	What impossible image convinces you it’s not real?
	•	How will you know you’ve truly woken up?

Yes — good instinct. Right now most of the Scenarios lean heavy into cosmic horror / weird. A few more grounded, prosaic missions would balance the deck so every session isn’t “unfathomable dreamscapes.” These can still spiral into horror, but they start with a straightforward salvage/rescue frame.

Here are two more in the cleaned format:

⸻

	•	Swarm of Drones (Threat)

Prompts:

	•	Cryo Survivor (NPC)
	•	Desperate Technician (NPC)

Prompts:
	•	What detail makes the survivors immediately suspicious?
	•	Who among you insists “saving them” is the right thing to do?
	•	What truth do they finally admit — too late?
