🎴 Soldier Deck

✅ With this:
	•	Health (fixed: 4 Strikes)
	•	Defense (pick 1) → how you survive
	•	Boon (pick 1) → how you excel
	•	Deck Draws (2–3 cards) → backgrounds, gear, special moves

So a Soldier could be:
	•	Combat Armor + Marksman → classic marine.
	•	Reactive Dodge + Melee Specialist → fast knife fighter.
	•	Bulwark Stance + Tactical Instincts → shield wall leader.
