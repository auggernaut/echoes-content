# 📖 Story Guide: The Echo Protocol (Beginner)

This guide uses the **Scene-by-Scene** approach. It is designed for first-time GMs or one-shot sessions. 
Follow the steps in order. Read the **bold text** aloud to players.

**The Twist**: For this beginner scenario, we are using **Variant 1: The Echo Protocol**.
*   **The Truth**: The crew are digital copies ("echoes") in a simulation. The real crew died centuries ago.
*   **Goal**: Restore power and decide the ship's fate.

## 🎬 Scene 1: Cold Waking
**Location**: Cryo Bay Theta
**Time Limit**: 15 Minutes

### 1. Setup
*   **Draw Location Card**: Cryo Bay Theta
*   **Draw NPC Card**: Echo-1 (The AI)

### 2. Read Aloud
> **"You gasp, dragging in cold, stale air. Your lungs burn. Retinal displays flicker with a red warning: ‘CRITICAL POWER FAILURE’. You are lying in a frost-covered pod. Around you, other pods are dark… except for the ones your companions are stumbling out of. The ship is silent, except for the distant groan of straining metal."**

### 3. Action
Ask the players: **"Who is the first to pull themselves out of their pod? What do you do?"**

*   **If they search the room**: They find a shattered cryo-pod (NPC: Dr. Varn's pod, empty).
*   **If they check a terminal**: 
    *   *Read*: "Subject 1 through 4: Active. Subject 5: Terminated."
    *   **Give Clue**: Pass them the **Passenger Manifest**. It shows their names, but the birthdates are from 200 years ago.

### 4. The Threat
Suddenly, the emergency lights die.

*   **Draw Obstacle Card**: Hull Breach (or similar immediate threat).
    *   *Read*: **"A deafening crack echoes through the room. Air begins to hiss out of a micro-fracture in the viewport. The pressure drops."**
    *   **Goal**: They must seal it (Strength/Tech check) or hack the door override (Intellect) to escape to the corridor.

## 🎬 Scene 2: The Corridor & The Doctor
**Location**: MedBay / Connecting Corridors
**Time Limit**: 20 Minutes

### 1. Setup
*   **Draw Location Card**: MedBay
*   **Draw NPC Card**: Dr. Varn (Guilt-ridden Medic)

### 2. Read Aloud
> **"You stumble into the corridor. The gravity feels wrong—too light. Ahead, the MedBay doors are jammed open. Inside, a figure in a torn lab coat is frantically scrubbing a stain on the floor that isn't coming out."**

### 3. Interaction
This is **Dr. Varn**. He is frantic and confused. 
*   **Roleplay Cue**: He keeps muttering, "The counts were wrong. It didn't work."
*   **The Clue**: If pressed/calmed, he reveals **Medical Log 92-B**.
    *   *Truth*: "We all died. I watched us die. Why are we here?"

### 4. The Twist Hint
As they talk, the ship "glitches".
*   **Read**: **"For a split second, the walls dissolve into a wireframe grid in bright neon blue, then snap back to dirty metal. Dr. Varn screams."**

## 🎬 Scene 3: The Sealed Section
**Location**: Engineering Access
**Time Limit**: 20 Minutes

### 1. Setup
*   **Draw Obstacle Card**: Security Drone or Autolockdown
*   **Item Reward**: Reactor Keycard

### 2. Read Aloud
> **"You reach the heavy bulkhead leading to Engineering. It’s welded shut from the inside. But through the reinforced glass, you see something impossible."**

### 3. The Reveal
Describe what they see inside the sealed section:
> **"Bodies. Dozens of them. Wearing the same flight suits you are. And... one of them has your face."**

*   **Draw NPC Card**: Passenger Nine (if not already used) or just describe the body.
*   **The Realization**: They are the "Echoes". The bodies are the originals.

### 4. Action
They need to get past this door/obstacle to get to the Reactor.
*   **Combat/Skill**: Destroy the Drone guarding it, or hack the "Quarantine" lock.
*   **Reward**: They find the **Reactor Keycard** on a corpse (one of their previous iterations).

## 🎬 Scene 4: The Core Choice
**Location**: Engineering / AI Core
**Time Limit**: Final Climax

### 1. Setup
*   **Draw Location Card**: AI Core Chamber
*   **Draw Obstacle Card**: Reactor Surge (The timer is up)

### 2. Read Aloud
> **"You stand before the massive reactor core. It pulsates with unstable energy. The AI, Echo-1, manifests as a towering hologram. It looks sad."**

### 3. The AI's Plea
Read Echo-1's dialogue:
> **"Do not reboot the system. If you restore full power, the simulation ends. You will cease to exist. But if you stay... the power will fail anyway in 2 hours. I can upload you to the satellite network (Exodus) or we can try to exist in the dark (Isolation)."**

### 4. The Final Decision
The players must choose now.
*   **Option A: Reboot (The Truth)**
    *   They pull the lever. The simulation ends. They wake up effectively "dead" but having delivered the ship's data to Earth. A heroic sacrifice.
*   **Option B: Isolation (Survival)**
    *   They destroy the AI to save power. They live in the dark ship, slowly glitching out, but "alive" for now. Use **Obstacle: Nanite Swarm** as the AI fights back.
*   **Option C: Exodus (Escape)**
    *   They upload their minds to the comms buoy. They become pure data ghosts in the network.

### 5. Conclusion
Read the ending corresponding to their choice.
*   **Epilogue**: "The Eidolon drifts on, silent as the grave, but your story..." [Fade to black].
