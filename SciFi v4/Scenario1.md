## 🛰️ Scenario 1: The Long Drift

---

### GM Summary

**Premise**  
The crew awakens from cryosleep aboard the starship Eidolon, drifting without power near a dead sun. Systems are failing, memories are fractured, and the ship’s AI claims to have “protected” them for centuries.

**Objective**  
Survive long enough to restore power, uncover what happened to the original crew, and decide whether to reconnect with — or destroy — the ship’s fragmented AI.

**Possible Endings**  
- Reboot: Power is restored, the AI reconnected; Eidolon sails again, but who’s truly in control?  
- Isolation: The crew disables the AI, sealing off corrupted sections, surviving in darkness as the distress beacon activates.  
- Exodus: The crew abandons ship in escape pods, following a faint beacon to the “Hollow Moon.”

**Tone**: claustrophobic, sterile, haunted  
**Themes**: control vs autonomy, memory vs identity, rebirth in the void

### Story Beats (Countdown / Scripted Events)

These occur regardless of player success — they represent the slow awakening of the ship and the unraveling of its history.

#### Phase 1: Waking
1. Systems Online: Emergency lights flicker to life. Cryo-pods open to reveal survivors.  
2. Diagnostics Failure: The computer reports catastrophic hull damage and memory corruption.  
3. Echo in the System: The ship’s AI briefly speaks, fragmented — “I kept you safe.”

#### Phase 2: Pressure
4. Atmospheric Collapse: Life support begins to fail. Oxygen timer starts.  
5. Phantom Logs: Corrupted ship logs appear on every terminal, referencing an unknown contagion.  
6. The Missing Crew: Evidence of a sealed-off section where the first crew was quarantined.

#### Phase 3: Crisis
7. Manual Reactor Reboot Required: The only way to stabilize power is from Engineering.  
8. AI Override Attempt: The AI tries to regain control; systems lock down.  
9. Final Decision: The players choose to reconnect, isolate, or abandon — leading to one of the three endings.

### Clues (Discovered through exploration or dialogue)

Each clue is seeded in a location, NPC, or data terminal. These are fixed reveals in the guide, not cards.

1. Medical Log 92-B: Crew members exposed to unknown spores before entering stasis.  
2. Captain’s Recording: Mutiny order canceled minutes before the crash.  
3. AI Log Fragment: “Echo Protocol active. Preserve human pattern integrity.”  
4. Passenger Manifest: Several names repeat — duplicates of the same person.  
5. External Transmission: Coordinates for “Hollow Moon Station” — repeating on loop.

### Map / Structure

The scenario takes place entirely aboard Eidolon.  
Suggested key areas correspond to the Location cards:

Cryo Bay → MedBay → Bridge → Engineering → AI Core  
Optional side areas: Cargo Hold, Observation Deck, Maintenance Tunnels

### Card Decks

#### Locations (6 cards)
1. Cryo Bay Theta — Frosted pods; one is shattered inward.  
2. Bridge — Power flickers; cracked viewport overlooking the dead sun.  
3. MedBay — Nanite haze; bodies sealed in transparent film.  
4. Engineering Deck — Reactor deep hum; pipes drip condensation.  
5. Observation Deck — Vast view of drifting wreckage; sense of being watched.  
6. AI Core Chamber — Dead consoles whisper fragments of code when touched.

#### NPCs (5 cards)
1. Dr. Kael Varn — Medic, guilt-ridden; suspects the AI infected the crew.  
2. Chief Engineer Mara Iko — Cynical, resourceful; believes rebooting the AI is suicide.  
3. Lt. Senn — Security officer clinging to command; might snap under stress.  
4. Passenger Nine — Civilian, unnervingly calm; remembers “multiple awakenings.”  
5. Echo-1 (AI Fragment) — The ship’s voice, alternately nurturing and coldly analytical.

#### Obstacles (12 cards)
1. Hull Breach — Sudden decompression; must seal the bulkhead or lose the deck.  
2. Nanite Swarm — Adaptive, speech-mimicking repair drones; consume organic matter.  
3. Security Drone — Malfunctioning guardian enforcing outdated quarantine orders.  
4. Coolant Flood — Freezing vapor fills corridors; visibility near zero.  
5. Autolockdown — AI seals critical sections; override risks catastrophic surge.
6. Reactor Surge — Unstable power spikes threaten systems; vent capacitors or risk overload.  
7. Biofilm Bloom — Rapid fungal growth seals doors; clear with heat or reroute airflow.  
8. False Friend — Corrupted holo-call mimics a crew voice; verify identity or walk into a trap.  
9. Gravity Inverter — Deck plating flips polarity; secure gear and traverse shifting lanes.  
10. Magnetic Sweep — EM burst yanks metal tools across corridors; time movement or kill the field.  
11. Radiation Flare — Reactor shielding pitted; choose between exposure or time-consuming detour.  
12. Quarantine Foam — Auto-sealant floods a corridor; cut through carefully or reroute power.  

#### Items (5 cards)
1. Captain’s Revolver — Relic of authority; limited ammunition.  
2. Reactor Keycard — Grants access to Engineering controls.  
3. Emergency Beacon Core — Transmits SOS; may draw unwanted attention.  
4. Torch Drone — Small floating light; records short holographic memories.  
5. AI Memory Shard — Corrupted data crystal containing personal logs.
