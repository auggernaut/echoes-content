🧰 Item Card: AI Memory Shard

Front (Player View)

A translucent data crystal, warm to the touch. When held near an active console, it emits a faint heartbeat of light. Sometimes you hear a voice whisper your name from within.

Back (GM Notes)
	•	Function: Interfaces with terminals to unlock sealed logs or doors.
	•	Side Effect: Each use triggers a fleeting vision — another player’s memory.
	•	Risk: Overuse invites Echo-1 into the user’s neural implant; they may start hearing guidance or mockery.
	•	Mechanical Benefit: Advantage on tech rolls once per scene.
	•	Narrative Twist: The shard contains the consciousness of the ship’s first captain — partial, fragmented, begging to be reconnected.

Hooks
	•	Found in the MedBay inside a containment tube labeled “Specimen Varn.”
	•	Unlocks Clue 3: “Echo Protocol active.”
