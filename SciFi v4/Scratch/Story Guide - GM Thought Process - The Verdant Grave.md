# 🧠 GM Thought Process: The Verdant Grave
## *Managing Bio-Horror and Environmental Stakes*

This guide demonstrates how a GM handles a **Bio-Horror** scenario, where the environment itself is as dangerous as the monsters.

---

## 🎲 The Draw
The GM pulls these cards from the deck:
*   **Locations**: [Hydroponics Wing], [The Gut (Maintenance)], [MedBay], [The Bridge]
*   **NPCs**: [Chief Engineer Mara Iko], [Dr. Kael Varn]
*   **Threats**: [Bio-Organic Hive], [Apex Predator]
*   **Loot**: [Universal Multi-Tool], [Thermal Siphon]

## 🧪 Phase 1: The Weave (GM Inner Monologue)
*The GM looks at the cards and thinks:*
> "I have the **Hydroponics Wing** as my anchor. The **Bio-Organic Hive** and **Apex Predator** suggest something is growing and hunting.
>
> **The Narrative Arc**: A mutation in Hydroponics has turned the deck into a jungle. **Mara Iko** has escaped but is traumatized. **Dr. Kael Varn** is missing—likely trapped in the **MedBay**, which is now overrun by the **Bio-Organic Hive**. The **Apex Predator** is the gardener.
>
> **The Goal**: Rescue Dr. Varn from the Hive-infested MedBay and use the **Thermal Siphon** (Loot) to flash-freeze the mutation's heart before it reaches the Bridge."

## ⚓ Phase 2: The Engagement (The Hook)
*The GM sets the scene and asks questions to establish why the characters care.*

**GM**: "The life support alarms on **The Bridge** are screaming. Oxygen is at 200%. The air tastes like wet earth and rotting sugar. **Chief Engineer Mara Iko** stumbles onto the deck, her jumpsuit shredded by thorns. 'The plants... they're breathing,' she gasps. 'Varn is still down there. He was trying to stabilize the scrubbers in the Wing.'"

### Setup Questions (Ask the Players)
*The GM turns to the characters to establish their emotional stakes:*
*   **To the Medic**: "Dr. Varn was your mentor. He taught you that 'sterile' is a lie. Why does the thought of him being trapped in an overgrown MedBay feel like a personal failure to you?"
*   **To the Engineer**: "The bridge controls are starting to feel... sticky. Thorns are bursting through the floor gratings. If the ship becomes more plant than metal, what part of your 'mechanical' identity are you most afraid of losing?"
*   **To the Security Officer**: "Standard munitions are useless against vines. You've heard rumors about 'The Verdant Grave' in other sectors—no one ever comes back. What did you promise yourself you'd do if you ever encountered a 'Class Red' bio-hazard?"

**GM Inner Monologue**:
> "I’m not changing the story. I’m asking **'Why do you care?'** By linking the Medic to Varn and the Engineer to the ship's mechanical integrity, I’ve turned the environmental cards into personal threats. Now the mission isn't just 'save the ship'—it's 'don't let your mentor die' and 'don't let the plants win.'"

## 🎬 Phase 3: Setting the Scene & The Loop
*The players reach the entrance to the **Hydroponics Wing**. The GM places the card.*

**GM**: "The air here is thick. The UV lights are flickering green. Pale vines have burst from their tanks. **What do you do?**"

**Player (Engineer)**: "The vines are blocking the door. I want to use my plasma torch to cut through them."

**GM**: "That’s risky. The air is 200% oxygen. **Do you have anything that could help with that?**"

**Player**: "I have the **[Universal Multi-Tool]**. It has a plasma torch, but also a scanner. Maybe I can find a way to cut them without sparking an explosion?"

**GM**: "Good thinking. Read the card's **Risk** aloud."

**Player**: *"Risk: [Sticky Trigger]: If used for a desperate repair (rolling a 1), the plasma torch triggers fire suppression (Bane on all actions)..."*

**GM**: "Since you're scanning for the 'coldest' path through the vines first, the **Difficulty Rating (DR) is a 4**. If you roll a 1, the high oxygen might ignite. Roll 2d6 and take the highest."

**GM Inner Monologue**:
> "The player used their card properly. I set the DR at 4 because the oxygen makes it dangerous. I'm keeping the DR high to respect the [Oversized Oxygen Levels] hazard on the [Hydroponics Wing] card, even with their tool."

## 🎢 Phase 4: Dynamic Interaction
*The player rolls a 5. Success. They enter and find the **Bio-Organic Hive**.*

**GM**: "The MedBay is unrecognizable. It's a pulsating mass of violet veins and wet skin. You see a hand—Dr. Varn's—clutching a silver canister."

**GM Inner Monologue**: *The [Bio-Organic Hive] card (Back) says it’s 'Immune to piercing' but takes 'Double damage from Fire.' I need to see if the players realize this.*

**Player (Medic)**: "I'm going to pull him out! I don't care about the vines!"

**GM**: "The hive reacts to your movement. It starts to entangle you. **Do you have anything to help?**"

**Player (Engineer)**: "I'm using the **[Thermal Siphon]** we found! I'll crack it near the hive."

**GM**: "Read that card's **Mechanical Benefit**."

**Player**: *"Creates a [Frigid] hazard zone... biological creatures entering the zone lose their next action to thermal shock."*

**GM**: "The hive isn't just stalled—the cold shatters the violet vines. The **DR to pull Varn out drops to a 2**. It’s a total override."

## 🏁 Resolution: The "Why"
**GM Education Note**:
-   The GM used the **High Oxygen** hazard to make a simple task (cutting vines) feel tense.
-   The GM used the **Back of the Hive** card to reward the players for using a 'Cold' tool ([Thermal Siphon]) against a 'Heat' sensitive threat.
-   By always asking **"Do you have anything that could help?"**, the players felt like their inventory was their survival kit, not just a list of stats.
