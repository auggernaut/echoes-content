# 🧠 GM Education: The Silent Mutiny
## *Managing Human Conflict and Tactical Pressure*

This guide teaches you how to run **The Silent Mutiny**, a scenario focused on intrigue, shifting loyalties, and high-stakes technical lockdowns.

---

## 🎲 The Draw
To run this scenario, you will need these cards from the deck:
*   **Locations**: [The Bridge], [AI Core Chamber], [Observation Deck], [The Gut (Maintenance)]
*   **NPCs**: [Lt. Senn], [Chief Engineer Mara Iko]
*   **Threats**: [Rogue Sentry]
*   **Loot**: [AI Memory Shard], [Bridge Key]

## ⚓ Phase 1: The Weave (GM Inner Monologue)
*The GM looks at the cards and thinks:*
> "This isn't a monster hunt; it's a chess match. **Lt. Senn** is the king, and the **Rogue Sentries** are his pawns.
>
> **The Narrative Arc**: Senn has taken the Bridge. He believes the ship—and the crew—are compromised and needs to 'reset' the AI to fix it. This will kill everyone currently on board. But Senn isn't a villain in his own mind; he's a savior.
>
> **The Goal**: The PCs need to either talk Senn down, bypass the security lockdown on the **Bridge**, or sneak into the **AI Core Chamber** to manually override the reset."

## ⚓ Phase 2: The Engagement (Narrative Prompts)
Start by reading the **Hook** from the Scenario Guide. Then, use the **Hook Questions** to ground the players:

*   **GM**: "The bulkheads hiss shut, sealing you in. Senn's voice is calm, almost pitying. *'I'm doing this for the mission,'* he says. Before you act, tell me: **What did Senn do during the last inspection that made you realize he was breaking?**"
*   **Player (Medic)**: "He refused to look me in the eye when I was treating his tremors. He just kept staring at the AI core monitors."
*   **GM**: "Excellent. You see that same cold distance in the way the **Rogue Sentries** move now. They aren't just patrolling; they're hunting disloyalty."

---

## ⚓ Phase 3: The Interaction (Card Usage)
When the players reach a location, use the card's **Hazards** and **Reveals** to drive the story.

### Example: The AI Core Chamber
*   **GM**: "You've reached the AI Core. The air is cold and hums with power. You need to reach the **Manual Kill Switch**, but the floor is a lattice of active energy."
*   **Player (Security)**: "I want to dash across. I'm fast."
*   **GM**: "The card lists **Neuro-shock** as a Hazard. It's a DR 5+ check. If you fail, the shock will seize your muscles. However, there's a **Manual Kill Switch** (Reveal) hidden under a floor panel. A character with **[Tech]** or **[Security]** tags can find it without a roll if they take it slow."

## ⚓ Phase 4: The Rules (Difficulty Ratings)
As a GM, you decide the **Difficulty Rating (DR)** based on the tension.

| Task | Suggested DR | Logic |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Social**: Reasoning with Lt. Senn | **DR 7+** | Senn is deeply committed to his 'savior' narrative. |
| **Tech**: Hacking the Bridge Overrides | **DR 5+** | The hardware is standard, but the encryption is high. |
| **Combat**: Neutralizing a Rogue Sentry | **DR 4+** | They are fast but fragile (1 Strike). |

> [!TIP]
> **Boons and Banes**: If the player uses a **[Bridge Key]** (Loot), give them a **Boon (+1d6)** to the Bridge hack. If Senn is watching them via the cameras, apply a **Bane (-1d6)** to their Stealth rolls.

---

## ⚓ Phase 5: The Ending
The story ends when the PC's actions resolve the conflict:
*   **Resolution**: By returning the **AI Memory Shard** (Loot) to the core, the original AI wakes up and overrides Senn's control.
*   **Consequence**: If Senn is killed, the corporate bounty on the PCs might go active—he was a "Company Man," after all.
