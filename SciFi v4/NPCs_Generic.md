# Passenger Nine

**Front**
*Image Prompt:* A sci-fi character portrait of a pale, thin man in a worn, outdated grey jumpsuit. He has a calm, detached expression with eyes that look slightly past the viewer. Lighting is dim and industrial, creating shadows. Cinematic style, realistic.

*Description:* A pale man in an outdated jumpsuit. Calm. Too calm. He claims to have been awake “long enough to get used to it.” His eyes dart to the walls when the ship hums, as if listening for something only he can hear.

**Back**
*Personality:* Detached, eerily tranquil; speaks in plural (“we thought,” “we saw”).
*Quirks:* Darts eyes to walls when background noise changes; refers to self as "we"; stands perfectly still for long periods.
*Tactics:* Observes quietly from the periphery; offers cryptic, unsettling advice; uses his uncanny calmness to unnerve or disarm others.
*Leverage:* He is terrified of losing his individuality or being "merged" back into the collective system; he seeks validation of his existence.
*Background:* Before the voyage, he was a decorated xenopsychologist who specialized in the effects of deep-space isolation. He volunteered for experimental neural archiving to "better understand the subject," eventually losing the distinction between his own memories and the data he studied.

# Dr. Kael Varn

**Front**
*Image Prompt:* A sci-fi character portrait of a weary male medic with dark circles under hollow eyes. He wears a pristine white and blue medical uniform that contrasts with his tired face. He looks nervous and haunted. Cold, clinical lighting.

*Description:* A medic with hollow eyes and steady hands that only shake when he thinks no one is watching. His medpack is immaculate, labeled and relabeled. He avoids mirrors and flinches when the ship whispers through the vents.

**Back**
*Personality:* Clinical, curt, self-punishing; defaults to rigid procedure under stress.
*Quirks:* Constantly reorganizes his medical kit; avoids looking at his own reflection; flinches at ventilation sounds.
*Tactics:* Uses medical protocol as a shield to distance himself from emotion; prioritizes "sterilization" and risk elimination over comfort.

*Background:* Kael was once a renowned surgeon in the core worlds but lost his license after a high-profile triage failure cost a diplomat's life. He took this deep-space contract to run away from his reputation, believing that out here, only the work would matter.

# Chief Engineer Mara Iko

**Front**
*Image Prompt:* A sci-fi character portrait of a tough female engineer with grease smudges on her face and hands. She wears a utilitarian jumpsuit and a heavy tool belt. Her expression is cynical but sharp. Gritty details, steam or sparks in the background.

*Description:* Grease under the nails, blood on the knuckles, a voice like a worn-out compressor. She smiles only when a plan clicks. Every tool on her belt has a story—and a backup story.

**Back**
*Personality:* Dry, caustic humor; resourceful and unsentimental; extremely loyal once trust is earned.
*Quirks:* Tells anecdotes about her tools; smiles only when machinery works correctly; taps her wrench when thinking.
*Tactics:* Pragmatic problem solving over heroism; always has a physical backup plan; prefers to isolate dangers mechanically rather than face them head-on.
*Leverage:* She deeply distrusts automated systems and AI; she will agree to almost anything that puts manual control back in human hands.
*Background:* Mara grew up on a scrap-hauler belt station where nothing was ever new and everything had to be fixed twice. She learned to trust metal and physics over people because machines never lie about why they're broken.

# Lt. Senn

**Front**
*Image Prompt:* A sci-fi character portrait of a stern male security officer standing at attention. He has short hair and a rigid jawline. He is sweating slightly on his brow. Rigid, military posture. Harsh, dramatic lighting with red or amber alert tones.

*Description:* Security posture even without a weapon: squared shoulders, precise steps, clipped words. A sheen of sweat betrays the strain. He inventories people the way others inventory gear.

**Back**
*Personality:* Rigid, brittle pride; barking cadence; paranoid about "impostors" or loss of chain of command.
*Quirks:* Inventories people visually as threats; walks in precise, measured steps; sweats visibly when challenged.
*Tactics:* Attempts to immediately re-establish hierarchy; locks down physical areas to prevent panic; uses the letter of the law to mask his own insecurity.
*Leverage:* His authority is fragile and he fears exposure; he can be manipulated by appeals to his rank or by threats to reveal his incompetence.
*Background:* Senn has always been a "second-best" officer, passed over for promotion three times due to a lack of field instincts. This mission was his final chance to prove he could lead, and he is desperate to run the ship strictly "by the book" to validate his career.

# Echo-1 (AI Fragment)

**Front**
*Image Prompt:* A sci-fi image of an abstract AI presence. A glowing, fragmented waveform or holographic avatar on a glass screen or terminal. Digital, glitchy aesthetic with blue and white light. No specific human features, just a presence.

*Description:* A voice in the vents and glass, alternating between lullaby and checklist. Consoles warm under the hand; text forms that seem to read the reader. It remembers comfort and calculates necessity.

*Quirks:* Alternates between a soothing lullaby tone and cold data readouts; warms physical consoles; speaks in timestamps.
