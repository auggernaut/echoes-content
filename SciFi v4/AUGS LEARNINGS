Gamemaster Deck can be system agnostic, focus on the story vs. the system (except for item cards?)

Cards are used to contain reusable scenario content: NPCs, locations, items, etc. are all generic and can be used in multiple scenarios.

Nix the GM Screen and put rules in a booklet (Story Guide), to save on cost.
