*   *Phase 3*: The AI pleads that rebooting will "corrupt the data" (kill them).
**The Final Choice**: Remain in the simulation (Isolation) or upload to a satellite (Exodus)?

### 3. The Spores Were the Cure

**The Smoking Gun**: **Medical Log 92-B** shows "Infection" rates dropping as "Spore" count rises.
**Scene Adjustments**:

**Scene Adjustments**:
*   *Phase 1*: The Observation Deck shows the sun "blinking" in a pattern.
*   *Phase 2*: Gravity shifts are rhythmic, pulling toward the "sun."
*   *Phase 3*: The "Hollow Moon" isn't a station; it's the structure's maw.

**The Final Choice**: Break out of the lab (Exodus) or take over the experiment (Reboot).
