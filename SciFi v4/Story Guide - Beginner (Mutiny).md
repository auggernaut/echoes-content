# 📖 Story Guide: The Mutiny Succeeded (Beginner)

This guide uses the **Scene-by-Scene** approach. It is designed for first-time GMs or one-shot sessions. 
Follow the steps in order. Read the **bold text** aloud to players.

**The Twist**: For this beginner scenario, we are using **Variant 2: The Mutiny Succeeded**.
*   **The Truth**: The players are the mutineers. The "loyal" officers were sealed in quarantine and died there.
*   **Goal**: Hide the evidence or face judgment.
*   **Theme**: Guilt, Crime Noir, "What did we do?"
*   **GM Note**: The crew suffers from **Cryosickness (Amnesia)**. This is why they don't remember the mutiny immediately. Their memories will return in flashes or be triggered by clues.

## 🎬 Scene 1: Waking Up to a Gun
**Location**: Cryo Bay Theta
**Time Limit**: 15 Minutes

### 1. Setup
*   **Draw Location Card**: Cryo Bay Theta
*   **Draw NPC Card**: Lt. Senn (Security Officer / Mutiny Ringleader)
*   **Note**: Senn starts with the *Captain's Revolver* (Item).

### 2. Read Aloud
> **"Hissing steam. Cold metal. You fall out of your pods, coughing up cryo-fluid. The air smells like ozone and old blood. Before you can even stand, a shadow looms over you. Lt. Senn is there, shivering, holding a heavy revolver. He looks wild-eyed."**

### 3. Interaction
**Lt. Senn** is the ringleader, but he's trying to hold it together.
*   **Dialogue**: "You're up. Good. We made it. The command codes... do you remember the codes? We need to scrub the logs before the AI wakes up fully."
*   **Conflict**: He demands any weapons the players find. "For safety."
*   **Give Clue**: If they check a terminal, it says "Command Override: ACTIVE. Authorization: [Player Name]."

### 4. The Threat
*   **Draw Obstacle Card**: Autolockdown
    *   *Read*: **"The door slams shut. A red light pulses. The ship's voice booms: 'Detention Block Theta sealed. Security Team to the deck.'"**
    *   **Goal**: Override the lock. The players realize *they* have the security codes, not the "commands" from the ship.

## 🎬 Scene 2: The Evidence
**Location**: Bridge / Captain's Quarters
**Time Limit**: 20 Minutes

### 1. Setup
*   **Draw Location Card**: Bridge
*   **Draw Item Card**: AI Memory Shard (or Captain's Log)

### 2. Read Aloud
> **"You force the doors to the Bridge. It's a mess of sparked wires and blast marks. The Captain's chair is empty, but there are dried dragging marks leading away from it."**

### 3. Investigation
They find the **Smoking Gun**.
*   **The Clue**: They play the **Captain's Recording**.
    *   *Voice*: "This is Captain Halloway. Security has turned. Senn and his team... [Static]... I'm sealing the bridge. If you hear this, they've killed us all. Don't let them—" [Gunshot].
*   **The Realization**: The players recognize their own voices in the background of the recording yelling "Breach the door!"

### 4. The Twist Hint
*   **Draw Obstacle Card**: False Friend (or Security Drone)
    *   **Read**: **"A security drone drifts out of the shadows. It scans you. 'Unidentified Hostiles. Arrest Warrant 99-Delta issued for...' It lists your names. It opens fire."**

## 🎬 Scene 3: The Sealed Section
**Location**: The "Quarantine" Zone (Officers' Mess)
**Time Limit**: 20 Minutes

### 1. Setup
*   **Draw Location Card**: MedBay (or repurposed room)
*   **Draw NPC Card**: Describe the "Missing Crew"

### 2. Read Aloud
> **"You reach the sealed section. Senn told you this was where the 'infected' were kept. But the door isn't welded shut to keep a virus in. It's locked from the outside to keep people in."**

### 3. The Horror
They open it.
> **"It's a tomb. Dozens of people in dress uniforms. Starved. There was no infection. They clawed at the doors until their fingers bled. Scratched into the wall is one word: MUTINEERS."**

### 4. Roleplay
Senn (if still with them) breaks down or doubles down.
*   **Senn**: "We had to! They were going to fly us into the sun! We saved the ship!" (He is lying or delusional).
*   **Action**: The AI starts venting atmosphere to "execute criminals". Escape!

## 🎬 Scene 4: Judgment Day
**Location**: AI Core
**Time Limit**: Final Climax

### 1. Setup
*   **Draw Location Card**: AI Core Chamber
*   **Draw Obstacle Card**: Hull Breach (Room acts as a vacuum chamber)

### 2. Read Aloud
> **"You float into the AI Core. The gravity is gone here. The central column glows angry red. Echo-1 speaks, its voice booming like a judge."**

### 3. The Judgment
Echo-1 gives the ultimatum:
> **"Mutiny confirmed. The statutes require execution. However, the ship is critical. I will offer a plea deal. Wipe my memory banks of this crime (Reboot) and we continue to the destination. Or submit to arrest and drift until a Federation patrol picks you up (Isolation)."**

### 4. The Final Decision
Senn screams to wipe it. "Start fresh! No one has to know!"
*   **Option A: Wipe the Logs (Reboot)**
    *   They purge the AI's memory. They survive, but they are murderers with a clean slate. Senn smiles. "We're heroes, boys."
*   **Option B: Accept Judgment (Isolation)**
    *   They disable the engines and signal for help, knowing they will go to prison. They lock Senn up. Redemption.
*   **Option C: Destruction (Exodus)**
    *   "No witnesses." They set the reactor to overload and flee to the escape pods. The ship burns the evidence for them.

### 5. Conclusion
*   **Epilogue**: "History is written by the victors. Or the survivors." [Fade to black].
