# 📖 Beginner Adventure: The Mutiny

This adventure is designed for a first-time GM. It uses the **Generic Location** and **Generic NPC** cards to create a "Whodunit" where the players are the culprits.

## 🎭 Adventure Background (GM Only)
The mutiny was successful. The players, led by **Lt. Senn**, overthrew the officers and sealed them in the MedBay to die. However, a faulty cryo-dump during the takeover caused **Cryosickness (Amnesia)**. The players don't remember their crime. **Lt. Senn** is the only one who remembers, and he is lying to keep them on his side.

---

## 🧩 Global Mechanic: Cryosickness
The players begin with a **24-hour memory gap**. As they find clues, give them **Flashes of Insight**:
- *"For a split second, you remember the weight of a heavy revolver in your hand. You remember the sound of yourself screaming 'Open the door!' at a sealed bulkhead."*

## 🎬 Scene 1: Cryo Bay Theta
**Tags**: Frigid, Silent, Tomb-like
**Location Card**: [Cryo Bay Theta](file:///Users/home/Dev/git/echoes-content/SciFi%20v4/Locations_Generic.md#L20)

### 1. The Scene
> **"You fall from your pods, coughing up bitter blue cryo-fluid. The air smells like ozone and old blood. Before you can even wipe the frost from your eyes, a shadow looms over you. Lt. Senn is there—his uniform is stained, and he is holding a heavy revolver in a white-knuckled grip. He looks wild-eyed, but as he sees you, he lowers the weapon with a shaky sigh."**

### 2. The Situation
**Lt. Senn** is terrified that the players will remember the mutiny. He tells them: *"Good. You're up. The infection... the Captain went mad. We had to seal the Bridge. Do you remember the codes? We need to secure the ship."*

### 3. Player Options & Responses
- **If they check their own gear**: They find their weapons are missing. Senn has them "for safekeeping."
- **If they check the pod labeled 'Empty'**: See [Hidden Aspect](file:///Users/home/Dev/git/echoes-content/SciFi%20v4/Locations_Generic.md#L35). They find bio-residue that looks like dried blood on the inside of the glass.
- **If they ask Senn about the blood**: He flinches. [Tactics](file:///Users/home/Dev/git/echoes-content/SciFi%20v4/NPCs_Generic.md#L59): *"The Captain's first officer was... unstable. We had to restrain him. Come on, we’re wasting time."*

### 4. Moving Forward
Senn leads them toward the Bridge. He insists they go there to "wipe the logs of the Captain's infection" so they can signal for help.

## 🎬 Scene 2: The Bridge
**Tags**: Static-hissing, Cracked, Abandoned
**Location Card**: [The Bridge](file:///Users/home/Dev/git/echoes-content/SciFi%20v4/Locations_Generic.md#L39)

### 1. The Scene
> **"The Bridge doors hiss open to reveal a wreck. The main viewport is cracked, framing the stars like a shattered mirror. The Captain’s chair is empty, but there are dark dragging marks on the deck plates leading away from it. Static snow falls from the overhead monitors, casting a ghostly grey light over the wreckage."**

### 2. The Situation
The players are looking for the [Black Box Chip](file:///Users/home/Dev/git/echoes-content/SciFi%20v4/Locations_Generic.md#L54). Senn is trying to distract them by focusing on the **Navigation Console**.

### 3. Player Options & Responses
- **If they investigate the dragging marks**: They find a tooth on the floor and a discarded security badge belonging to the Captain.
- **If they find the Black Box Chip**: Playing it back reveals a recording. **Read Aloud**: *"This is Captain Halloway. Security has turned. Senn and his team... [Static]... they're venting the mess hall! If you hear this, they've killed us all!"*
- **If they confront Senn with the recording**: He defaults to his [Personality](file:///Users/home/Dev/git/echoes-content/SciFi%20v4/NPCs_Generic.md#L57): *"He was lying! A paranoid delusion! He was going to fly us into a star! I saved you!"*

### 4. Moving Forward
A red alert strobe begins. The AI core identifies the crew on the Bridge as "Criminal Elements." Automated drones deploy. Senn shouts: *"To the MedBay! We can seal ourselves in there!"*

## 🎬 Scene 3: The MedBay
**Tags**: Antiseptic, Sterile, Whirring
**Location Card**: [MedBay](file:///Users/home/Dev/git/echoes-content/SciFi%20v4/Locations_Generic.md#L58)

### 1. The Scene
> **"The MedBay is blindingly bright. Behind the reinforced glass of the Quarantine Fields, you see them—not patients, but dozens of bodies in dress uniforms. They aren't sick. They are starved. One of them is slumped against the glass, their fingers worn down to the bone from clawing at the seal. Scratched into the floor in front of them is one word: MUTINEERS."**

### 2. The Situation
This is the **Point of No Return**. The players realize they were the ones who locked the officers in here. **Dr. Kael Varn** is hiding behind a counter, shaking.

### 3. Player Options & Responses
- **If they talk to Kael Varn**: He looks at them with pure terror. [Leverage](file:///Users/home/Dev/git/echoes-content/SciFi%20v4/NPCs_Generic.md#L28): *"I just kept them sedated. You said it would only be for a day. You promised! Senn said you were taking over for the good of the colony!"*
- **If they check the Medical Logs**: They find a "Treatment Plan" signed by their own names. The treatment was "Permanent Isolation."

### 4. Moving Forward
The AI starts venting the MedBay atmosphere. *"Justice must be served."* The only way to live is to reach the AI Core and override the ship's brain.

## 🎬 Scene 4: The AI Core Chamber
**Tags**: Freezing, Hushed, Charged
**Location Card**: [AI Core Chamber](file:///Users/home/Dev/git/echoes-content/SciFi%20v4/Locations_Generic.md#L96)

### 1. The Scene
> **"The AI Core is a tomb of blue light. The gravity is failing now, and you float through a haze of floating ice crystals. The central column glows an angry red. The voice of Echo-1 speaks, no longer a recording, but a judge: 'Mutiny confirmed. The statutes require execution. State your final plea.'"**

### 2. The Situation
The players must decide their fate. Senn is screaming to wipe the memory banks.

### 3. The Final Choice
- **Path A: The Reboot (The Cover-Up)**: Use the [Memory Banks](file:///Users/home/Dev/git/echoes-content/SciFi%20v4/Locations_Generic.md#L109) to erase the ship's last 48 hours. **Response**: The AI resets. Senn smiles, his sweat freezing in the air. *"See? We're heroes again. Simple as that."*
- **Path B: The Isolation (The Surrender)**: Submit to the AI's arrest. **Response**: The players are locked in stasis. They will wake up in a Federation court. Senn is dragged away screaming.
- **Path C: The Exodus (Destruction)**: Overload the [Coolant Tanks](file:///Users/home/Dev/git/echoes-content/SciFi%20v4/Locations_Generic.md#L108). **Response**: The ship begins to tear itself apart. The players have 2 minutes to reach escape pods. The evidence will burn with the ship.

## 🏁 Conclusion
- **Epilogue**: "History is written by the survivors. But you will always know the truth." [Fade to Black].
- **GM Note**: If the players choose **The Reboot**, tell them that for months afterward, they occasionally see the word "MUTINEERS" appear in their dreams, or hear a ghost scratching at their pod glass.
