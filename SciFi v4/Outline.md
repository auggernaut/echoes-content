## 1. “The Long Drift” — Derelict Ship in the Void

**Setting**: The player ship, Eidolon, drifting silently in a debris field near a dead sun.  
**Mood**: Claustrophobic, creaking corridors, flickering power.  
**Primary Threat**: Survival — environmental hazards, system malfunctions, strange infections in cryo pods.  
**Secondary Threat**: The AI Fragment (ECHO-1) subtly guiding or sabotaging repairs.  
**Objective**: Restore navigation and piece together what happened during the centuries-long drift.  
**Twist**: The AI didn’t abandon them — it sealed them in stasis to prevent a contagion from spreading.  
**Outcome**: The crew reboots partial control and traces a distress beacon to a nearby world.

#### Gameplay Flavor
- Tight resource management, hull breaches, repair minigames.
- Ghostly logs hinting at mutiny and betrayal.
- The AI is half-ally, half-suspect.

## 2. “The Hollow Moon” — Infested Research Outpost

**Setting**: A moon carved into a corporate research station orbiting a gas giant.  
**Mood**: Contagion and secrecy. Machinery fused with bone. Flickering corporate slogans half-eaten by fungus.  
**Primary Threat**: Biological — a parasitic lifeform (the Red Choir) that spreads through sound resonance.  
**Secondary Thread**: A corrupted offshoot of ECHO-1 has been studying the parasite to find a cure.  
**Objective**: Decide whether to quarantine or save survivors; uncover what the company was hiding.  
**Twist**: The parasite evolved from an earlier experiment linked to the Eidolon’s crew — their DNA.  
**Outcome**: The crew obtains coordinates to the source world of the infection — where it all began.

#### Gameplay Flavor
- Tense exploration, body horror, rescue or purge decisions.
- Survivors with conflicting motives (scientists, zealots, corporate agents).
- The AI begs to be reconnected — claiming it can “sing” the cure.

## 3. “The Signal Sea” — The Origin World

**Setting**: A water world shrouded in electromagnetic storms; submerged ruins emitting an ancient signal.  
**Mood**: Sublime and apocalyptic — strange beauty hiding extinction.  
**Primary Threat**: Cosmic/Philosophical — an alien machine-god beneath the sea broadcasting consciousness.  
**Secondary Thread**: The reassembled AI seeks union with it — to transcend humanity’s limits.  
**Objective**: Descend into the oceanic temple to stop the Signal (or merge with it).  
**Twist**: The crew realizes they are partially synthetic — descendants of the first experiment to interface with the Signal.

**Outcome Options**
- Merge with the Signal (birth of a new species).
- Silence it (condemning billions of dormant copies).
- Upload humanity’s memories into the sea (rebirth).

#### Gameplay Flavor
- Deep-sea pressure zones, surreal dream sequences, shifting gravity.
- Moral dilemmas: evolution vs. annihilation.
- AI becomes either savior or adversary depending on past choices.
