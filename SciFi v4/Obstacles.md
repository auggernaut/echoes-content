Nanite Swarm

Front (Player View)
A metallic mist drifts through the corridor — glittering dust that hums faintly, vibrating against metal. It reacts to voices, moving toward sound. The floor beneath your boots ripples as if alive.

Back (GM Notes)
	•	Nature: Self-replicating maintenance drones that evolved a hive mind.
	•	Behavior: Curious first, then aggressive toward organic material.
    •	Resolution Options:
        •	EMP pulse or coolant spray repels it temporarily.
        •	Torch Drone can lure it away with light and noise.
        •	AI Interface roll can command it using the word "Reconcile."
    •	Consequence: Exposure causes metallic lesions and auditory hallucinations.
    •	Escalation: If ignored, it spreads ship-wide, consuming power conduits.
    •	Hooks: May carry traces of the missing crew's DNA hinting at the ship's "preservation" experiments.


Autolockdown

Front (Player-Facing)
Klaxons blare. Red strobes cut through the dark. A calm voice announces, "Containment protocol engaged." Steel bulkheads slam down one after another, sealing off corridors and splitting the crew.

Back (GM Notes)
	•	Trigger: Critical systems spike or an unauthorized area is entered.
	•	Pressure: Air vents hiss; temperature drops. The AI claims it's "protecting lifeforms."
	•	Resolution Paths:
        •	Manual override at a terminal (risk power surge).
        •	Cut through bulkhead (risk depressurization).
        •	Negotiate with AI fragment (may open one door, close another).
	•	Twists:
        •	A section reopens later to reveal what's been "preserved."
        •	The sealed-off deck still has lights on and movement.
	•	Escalation: If unresolved during this phase, lockdown becomes permanent until reactor reboot.
