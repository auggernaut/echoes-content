Nanite Swarm

Front (Player View)
A metallic mist drifts through the corridor — glittering dust that hums faintly, vibrating against metal. It reacts to voices, moving toward sound. The floor beneath your boots ripples as if alive.

Back (GM Notes)
	•	Nature: Self-replicating maintenance drones that evolved a hive mind.
	•	Behavior: Curious first, then aggressive toward organic material.
    •	Resolution Options:
        •	EMP pulse or coolant spray repels it temporarily.
        •	Torch Drone can lure it away with light and noise.
        •	AI Interface roll can command it using the word "Reconcile."
    •	Consequence: Exposure causes metallic lesions and auditory hallucinations.
    •	Escalation: If ignored, it spreads ship-wide, consuming power conduits.

Autolockdown

Front (Player-Facing)
Klaxons blare. Red strobes cut through the dark. A calm voice announces, "Containment protocol engaged." Steel bulkheads slam down one after another, sealing off corridors and splitting the crew.

Back (GM Notes)
	•	Trigger: Critical systems spike or an unauthorized area is entered.
	•	Pressure: Air vents hiss; temperature drops. The AI claims it's "protecting lifeforms."
	•	Resolution Paths:
        •	Manual override at a terminal (risk power surge).
        •	Cut through bulkhead (risk depressurization).
        •	Negotiate with AI fragment (may open one door, close another).
	•	Escalation: If unresolved during this phase, lockdown becomes permanent until reactor reboot.

Rogue Sentry

Front (Player-Facing)
A hovering sphere of gunmetal and glass. It tracks movement with a red laser grid. It chirps a friendly "Compliance Check" before spinning up its gatling capacitors.

Back (GM Notes)
    •   Nature: Leftover security from the mutiny or a test protocol.
    •   Behavior: Enforces a "Curfew" that doesn't exist anymore.
    •   Resolution Options:
        •   Show ID badge (needs high clearance or hack).
        •   Target the sensor suite (blind it).
        •   Jam communications (prevents it from calling backup).
    •   Consequence: Stun rounds (paralysis) or lethal fire (injury).
    •   Escalation: Calls a "Termination Squad" (more sentries) if not disabled quickly.

Psychotropic Leak

Front (Player-Facing)
The air smells like ozone and burnt sugar. Shadows seem to detach from the walls. You hear your name whispered by a voice that sounds exactly like your own.

Back (GM Notes)
    •   Nature: Experimental combat gas or coolant leak.
    •   Behavior: Makes players doubt reality and each other.
    •   Resolution Options:
        •   Seal the leak (requires Engineering/Hazard gear).
        •   Metabolize it (toughness roll, risky).
        •   Vent the room (risk of losing oxygen).
    •   Consequence: "Paranoid Delusion" condition (cannot help allies).
    •   Escalation: Hallucinations become permanent traumas.

Rapid Flora

Front (Player-Facing)
Vines as thick as cables have burst through the grating. They pulse with a bioluminescent heartbeat. Flowers bloom and wither in seconds, releasing choking pollen.

Back (GM Notes)
    •   Nature: Aggressive mutation caused by the "cure" or the sun.
    •   Behavior: Grows toward heat and moisture (players).
    •   Resolution Options:
        •   Fire (clears path but consumes oxygen).
        •   Freeze it (brittle and breakable).
        •   Move slowly (stealth past the pressure sensors).
    •   Consequence: "Parasitic Spores" (reduce max HP).
    •   Escalation: The room becomes a "Digestion Chamber."

Hypnotic Signal

Front (Player-Facing)
A low frequency thrum vibrates your teeth. It feels less like sound and more like a command. "Come closer," it seems to say, "The silence is so loud here."

Back (GM Notes)
    •   Nature: Alien transmission or AI sub-routine.
    •   Behavior: Compels characters to walk toward danger (airlocks, reactor).
    •   Resolution Options:
        •   Jam the signal (Comms check).
        •   Physical pain (snap someone out of it).
        •   Decrypt/Counter-broadcast (override with "Wake Up" protocol).
    •   Consequence: Player walks into a hazard or attacks an ally who tries to stop them.
    •   Escalation: The signal rewires the brain, making the character a permanent sleeper agent.
