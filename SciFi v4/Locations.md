🗺 Location Card: Engineering Deck

Front (Player View)

The air tastes metallic. Heat shimmers off the deckplates. A half-lit reactor core looms in the chamber’s center, breathing in mechanical gasps. Condensation drips from overhead pipes, hissing on contact with the reactor’s skin. Every few seconds, the lights dim and pulse like a dying heartbeat.

Back (GM Notes)
	•	Threat: unstable reactor core, electrical arcs.
	•	Action: Players can stabilize the ship’s power by performing reroute or manual reboot actions here.
	•	Moves: Escalate heat and dimming pulses; trigger a safety interlock that seals a hatch; surge power to force a risky manual vent.
	•	Checks: Technical rolls risk radiation exposure; failing draws “Nanite Swarm.”
	•	Reveals: Diagnostic terminal flickers with partial Medical Log 92‑B headers; hot metal tang in the air; floor vibrations pulse in time with a character’s heartbeat.

Hooks
	•	Dr. Kael Varn may rush here in panic to “sterilize” the ship.
	•	The Reactor Keycard allows access to deep-core controls.
	•	Overheating triggers the Phase 3 story beat: Manual Reactor Reboot Required.

🗺 Location Card: Cryo Bay Theta

Front (Player View)

A skin of frost turns the cryo‑pods into glass sarcophagi. One capsule is shattered inward, glittering with glass dust. Emergency strips pulse a weak red through vapor, and cold breath blooms in the air. Medical readouts blink unreadably; frozen stasis gel beads on the deck with an antiseptic sweetness.

Back (GM Notes)
Threat: hypoxia, brittle frost hazards, hairline hull leaks, cryo-fluid spill.
Action: Revive survivors, triage injuries, salvage medkits and O2 canisters; seal the shattered pod.
Moves: Lock a door with quarantine foam; crack a weak seal to hiss cold vapor; wake an unexpected pod’s occupant.
Checks: Medical or Technical checks risk hypothermia; failing draws “Quarantine Foam” or “Autolockdown.”
Reveals: Frost‑laced breath and red strobe halos; a warning etched inside a fogged pod; occasional ping of contracting glass. Passenger Manifest repeats names when the terminal warms.

Hooks
	•	Passenger Nine awakens here, murmuring about “multiple awakenings.”
	•	Lt. Senn attempts to seize command and weapons distribution.
	•	Forcing the shattered pod risks “Hull Breach” as seals fail inward.

🗺 Location Card: Bridge

Front (Player View)

A cracked viewport frames the dead sun like a black coin. Chairs are still buckled; consoles breathe to life in uneven pulses, shedding static snow. Loose paperwork and straps drift, tugged by intermittent grav shifts. A faint comm light blinks, trying to say something through the noise.

Back (GM Notes)
	•	Threat: fractured viewport integrity, unsecured debris, failing inertial dampeners.
	•	Action: Bring sensors/comms online, route the Emergency Beacon Core, pull command logs.
	•	Moves: Static bleeds voices into comms; navigation flickers to a new course; a security drone approaches on an old lockdown order.
	•	Checks: Command/Computers vs corrupted firmware; failing draws “Security Drone.”
	•	Reveals: Ozone bite and hair‑raising static; hissing carrier that becomes a distant choir if everyone holds still; captain’s chair reveals a hidden recording; damaged comms loop faint “Hollow Moon” coordinates.

Hooks
	•	Captain’s Revolver is mag-locked inside the command locker.
	•	Reinitializing navigation lighting advances story beats and paints a target for scavengers.
	•	Lt. Senn may barricade the door and declare martial protocol.

🗺 Location Card: MedBay

Front (Player View)

Nanite haze hangs like glittering dust in sterile light. Bodies lie sealed under transparent film, faces smoothed by auto-foam. Auto-doc arms twitch to life, then freeze mid-motion. The air smells like antiseptic and hot metal, with a sweetness that shouldn’t be there.

Back (GM Notes)
	•	Threat: adaptive nanites, auto-surgeon miscalibration, instant quarantine seals.
	•	Action: Purge nanites, analyze spore exposure, craft anti-radiation packs, treat cryo trauma.
	•	Moves: Nanites coalesce around heat sources; quarantine seals slam; auto-doc misfires a cutting routine.
	•	Checks: Medical/Science; failing draws “Nanite Swarm.”
	•	Reveals: Antiseptic sweetness under hot metal; glittering nanite drift in light beams; monitors quietly begin syncing to a character’s pulse after a minute.

Hooks
	•	Dr. Kael Varn pushes to “sterilize the ship” from here, escalating tension.
	•	Clearing the haze earns Kael’s trust and access to controlled meds.
	•	“Biofilm Bloom” can seal MedBay mid-procedure, forcing a detour or risky heat-clearing.

🗺 Location Card: Observation Deck

Front (Player View)

Floor-to-ceiling glass looks out onto tumbling wreckage and the lightless sun. For a moment, shadows seem to move on the far side of the glass, as if the ship has an audience. The room groans and clicks as temperature shifts crawl through the hull.

Back (GM Notes)
	•	Threat: brittle viewport, gravity flickers, vertigo and spatial disorientation.
	•	Action: Scan wreckage, align comm dish for line-of-sight, recover an AI Memory Shard lodged in the telescope gimbal.
	•	Moves: Glass hairlines with a long creak; gravity flickers mid-step; a false signal lures them to open a dangerous channel.
	•	Checks: Perception/Navigation; failing draws “Magnetic Sweep” or “Gravity Inverter.”
	•	Reveals: Cold glass “breathes” with temperature shifts; vertigo tug as stars roll; distant, irregular hull thunks; dust motes align like constellations, then scatter.

Hooks
	•	Passenger Nine visits to “watch the loops” of drifting light and memory.
	•	A Torch Drone records a silhouette outside that turns out to be a “False Friend.”
	•	Spotting etched plating foreshadows the phrase “Hollow Moon” in later transmissions.

🗺 Location Card: AI Core Chamber

Front (Player View)

Cable looms gather like roots around a cold, black obelisk of memory lattice. Consoles sit dark, their glass catching thin threads of reflected light. The temperature drops with each step toward the core, and breath crystallizes in the air.

Back (GM Notes)
	•	Threat: electrical feedback, psychic pressure from the core, system lockdown traps.
	•	Action: Isolate or reconnect the core, fork Echo‑1 into a sandbox, install or purge memory shards.
	•	Moves: Lock down access nodes; push a tempting memory shard; initiate an AI override timer.
	•	Checks: Systems/Willpower vs AI intrusion; failing draws “Autolockdown” or “Reactor Surge.”
	•	Reveals: Breath crystallizes and sound dulls near the core; touch returns code fragments; consoles surface “Echo Protocol active. Preserve human pattern integrity.”

Hooks
	•	Echo‑1 bargains for agency and offers “protection” at a price.
	•	Linking to the core sets up Phase 3: AI Override Attempt.
	•	Using an AI Memory Shard reveals personal logs that reframe the mutiny.
