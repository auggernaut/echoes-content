## 🎯 GM Summary

**Premise**  
The crew awakens from cryosleep aboard the starship Eidolon, drifting without power near a dead sun. Systems are failing, memories are fractured, and the ship's AI claims to have "protected" them for centuries.

**Objective**  
Survive long enough to restore power, uncover what happened to the original crew, and decide whether to reconnect with — or destroy — the ship's fragmented AI.

**Possible Endings**  
- **Reboot**: Power is restored, the AI reconnected; Eidolon sails again, but who's truly in control?  
- **Isolation**: The crew disables the AI, sealing off corrupted sections, surviving in darkness as the distress beacon activates.  
- **Exodus**: The crew abandons ship in escape pods, following a faint beacon to the "Hollow Moon."

**Tone**: claustrophobic, sterile, haunted  
**Themes**: control vs autonomy, memory vs identity, rebirth in the void

## 🔀 Your Twist (Draw Before Play)

**⚠️ IMPORTANT**: Before running the scenario, draw ONE Twist card from `Twists.md`. This is your scenario's core secret. Everything else should be filtered through this lens.

**How to use your Twist:**
- **Early hints** (Phase 1): Drop subtle clues that don't make sense yet
- **Partial reveals** (Phase 2): Let players discover evidence that points toward the twist
- **Full reveal** (Phase 3): The twist becomes clear through a major discovery or NPC confession

**Example**: If you drew "The Echo Protocol":
- Phase 1: Passenger Nine mentions "feeling like they've done this before"
- Phase 2: Players find duplicate names on the manifest
- Phase 3: The AI reveals the truth when confronted, or players discover the simulation logs

## 📍 Story Beats (Automatic Events)

These occur regardless of player success — they represent the slow awakening of the ship and the unraveling of its history. Trigger them on a timer (every 15–20 minutes) or after resolving major Obstacles.

### Phase 1: Waking
1. **Systems Online**: Emergency lights flicker to life. Cryo-pods open to reveal survivors.  
2. **Diagnostics Failure**: The computer reports catastrophic hull damage and memory corruption.  
3. **Echo in the System**: The ship's AI briefly speaks, fragmented — "I kept you safe."

### Phase 2: Pressure
4. **Atmospheric Collapse**: Life support begins to fail. Oxygen timer starts.  
5. **Phantom Logs**: Corrupted ship logs appear on every terminal, referencing an unknown contagion.  
6. **The Missing Crew**: Evidence of a sealed-off section where the first crew was quarantined.

### Phase 3: Crisis
7. **Manual Reactor Reboot Required**: The only way to stabilize power is from Engineering.  
8. **AI Override Attempt**: The AI tries to regain control; systems lock down.  
9. **Final Decision**: The players choose to reconnect, isolate, or abandon — leading to one of the three endings.

## 🔍 Clues (Fixed Reveals)

Each clue must be discovered during play. **Decide where each will be found before the game starts**, but let players discover them naturally through exploration or dialogue.

### The Five Clues

1. **Medical Log 92-B**: Crew members exposed to unknown spores before entering stasis.  
   *Suggested locations: MedBay terminal, Dr. Varn's personal logs, Torch Drone recording*

2. **Captain's Recording**: Mutiny order canceled minutes before the crash.  
   *Suggested locations: Bridge command console, Captain's quarters, AI Memory Shard*

3. **AI Log Fragment**: "Echo Protocol active. Preserve human pattern integrity."  
   *Suggested locations: AI Core Chamber, corrupted data terminal, Engineering diagnostic logs*

4. **Passenger Manifest**: Several names repeat — duplicates of the same person.  
   *Suggested locations: Bridge navigation console, Cargo Hold records, Passenger Nine's belongings*

5. **External Transmission**: Coordinates for "Hollow Moon Station" — repeating on loop.  
   *Suggested locations: Bridge communications array, Observation Deck sensor panel, Emergency Beacon Core*

### Clue Placement Tips

- **Spread them out**: Don't put all clues in one location
- **Mix discovery methods**: Some via terminals, some via NPCs, some via items
- **Connect to your Twist**: Adjust clue wording or context to hint at your twist
- **Let players work**: Don't force clues — let exploration reveal them

## 🗺️ Map / Structure

The scenario takes place entirely aboard Eidolon.  
Suggested key areas correspond to the Location cards:

**Main Path**: Cryo Bay → MedBay → Bridge → Engineering → AI Core  
**Optional side areas**: Cargo Hold, Observation Deck, Maintenance Tunnels

**Progression**: Players will naturally move toward Engineering (to restore power) and the AI Core (to confront the AI). Side areas offer clues, items, and obstacles.

## 🎮 Running the Game

### Opening Scene
Start with the players' cryo-pods opening. Describe the cold, the grogginess, the flickering emergency lights. Have them check on each other — who's here? Who's missing? Then trigger Beat 1: Systems Online.

### Pacing
- **Phase 1 (Waking)**: Exploration and discovery. Players learn the ship's state, meet NPCs, find initial clues.
- **Phase 2 (Pressure)**: Urgency increases. Life support failing, obstacles more dangerous, twist hints become clearer.
- **Phase 3 (Crisis)**: Final push. Players must make hard choices leading to an ending.

### When to Reveal Your Twist
- **Phase 1**: Drop hints that don't make sense yet (e.g., Passenger Nine's odd memories)
- **Phase 2**: Players discover evidence pointing toward the twist (e.g., duplicate manifest entries)
- **Phase 3**: Full reveal through major discovery, NPC confession, or AI confrontation

### Player Agency
- Let players explore freely — don't force them down a path
- Clues can be found in multiple ways — be flexible
- NPCs react to player choices — build trust or suspicion
- All three endings are valid — let players choose

### Ending Transition
After the final decision, the distress beacon activates and transmits "Hollow Moon Station" coordinates — leading directly into Scenario 2.

- [ ] Draw your Twist before play
- [ ] Note which clues connect to your Twist
- [ ] Adjust NPC knowledge/behavior based on Twist
- [ ] Plan when to drop hints vs. full reveal
- [ ] Consider how each ending works with your Twist

### Story Beat Triggers

### Common Player Questions
- **"What happened to the crew?"** → Reveal through clues and NPCs, filtered through your Twist
- **"Can we trust the AI?"** → Depends on your Twist — some twists make AI trustworthy, others don't
- **"What's in the sealed section?"** → Depends on your Twist — could be originals, mutineers, test subjects, etc.
- **"Should we go to Hollow Moon?"** → Depends on your Twist — could be salvation or trap

## 💡 GM Tips

- **Atmosphere**: Emphasize the silence, the creaking ship, the flickering lights. Use sensory details.
- **NPCs**: Give each NPC a clear voice and motivation. They're not just info dumps.
- **Obstacles**: Make them feel dangerous but solvable. Players should feel clever when they overcome them.
- **Twist**: Don't force it. Let it emerge naturally. Players discovering the twist feels better than you telling them.
- **Endings**: All three are valid. Don't push players toward one — let them choose based on what they've learned.
