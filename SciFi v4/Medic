🎴 Medic Deck (10 Cards)

⸻

✅ With this:
	•	Defense (pick 1) → how you survive (includes Health)
	•	Boon (pick 1) → how you excel
	•	Deck Draws (2–3 cards) → backgrounds, gear, special moves

So a Medic could be:
	•	Clinical Distance + Field Medic → detached professional.
	•	Emergency Protocol + Nanite Specialist → tech-focused healer.
	•	Self-Sacrifice + Trauma Surgeon → desperate guardian.
