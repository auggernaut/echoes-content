🎴 Engineer Deck (10 Cards)

⸻

✅ With this:
	•	Defense (pick 1) → how you survive (includes Health)
	•	Boon (pick 1) → how you excel
	•	Deck Draws (2–3 cards) → backgrounds, gear, special moves

So an Engineer could be:
	•	Emergency Override + Systems Savant → classic ship technician.
	•	Dive for Cover + Mechanical Instincts → quick improviser.
	•	Failsafe Trigger + Data Whisperer → paranoid systems analyst.

Emergency Override
Defense
Prepared, Cunning

	•	Who hates me for always cutting corners?

⸻

	•	Who do I always leave behind when I scramble?
	•	What scar proves I wasn't fast enough once?
