# Engineering Deck
Overheated, Thrumming, Metallic

**Front**
*Image Prompt:* A sci-fi concept art of a spaceship engineering bay. A massive, cylindrical reactor core sits in the center, glowing with unstable pulsing blue and orange light. The room is industrial, filled with pipes, steam, and metal gratings. High contrast, sweaty atmosphere, heat distortion.

*First Impressions:* The air tastes metallic. Heat shimmers off the deckplates. A half-lit reactor core looms in the chamber’s center, breathing in mechanical gasps. Condensation drips from overhead pipes, hissing on contact with the reactor’s skin. Every few seconds, the lights dim and pulse like a dying heartbeat.

**Back**
*Atmosphere:* Oppressive heat, heavy industrial noise, and a sense of volatility. The ship feels like a living, suffering beast here.
*Sensory Details:* The taste of copper/blood in the mouth (ozone); the rhythmic thrum of the drive that vibrates in the teeth; the hiss of escaping steam; lighting that shifts from emergency red to failing white.
*Key Features:*
*   **The Core:** A massive, shielded column that requires manual tuning or venting.
*   **Catwalks:** Metal grating walkways that are slippery with condensation and oil.
*   **Control Station:** A hardened terminal for managing power distribution, often locked or damaged.
*Hazards:* Electrical arcs from exposed wiring; sudden steam vents (thermal damage); radiation leaks near the core shielding.
*Hidden Aspects:* A maintenance crawlspace beneath the main deck allows access to the core's physical couplings; vibrations on the floor sometimes sync with a person's heartbeat rather than the engine.

# Cryo Bay Theta
Frigid, Silent, Tomb-like

**Front**
*Image Prompt:* A sci-fi interior of a cryosleep chamber. Rows of vertical glass pods line the walls, some frosted over, some broken. Dim blue emergency lighting. Mist or vapor covers the floor. One pod is shattered. Eerie, silent, cold.

*First Impressions:* A skin of frost turns the cryo‑pods into glass sarcophagi. One capsule is shattered inward, glittering with glass dust. Emergency strips pulse a weak red through vapor, and cold breath blooms in the air. Medical readouts blink unreadably; frozen stasis gel beads on the deck with an antiseptic sweetness.

**Back**
*Atmosphere:* Tomb-like stillness, biting cold, and the preservation of the dead (or sleeping).
*Sensory Details:* The crunch of frost under boots; the complete absence of machine hum (silence); the smell of recycled air and chemical coolant; the red strobe of a failed pod alarm.
*Key Features:*
*   **Cryo Pods:** Glass coffins, some occupied, some empty. Can be scanned for bio-signs.
*   **Revival Station:** A medical terminal for safely waking crew, often requiring specific codes/drugs.
*   **Emergency Lockers:** Contains O2 masks and thermal blankets.
*Hazards:* Hypoxia (low oxygen); exposure to extreme cold (cryo-fluids); slippery ice; quarantine protocols sealing the room.
*Hidden Aspects:* Scratches on the *inside* of a glass pod; a pod labeled "Empty" that contains bio-residue; a manual release lever painted over to look like a pipe.

# The Bridge
Static-hissing, Cracked, Abandoned

**Front**
*Image Prompt:* A sci-fi spaceship bridge. The main viewport is cracked, showing a view of a starry void or a planet. Captain's chair in the center, surrounded by control consoles. Debris strewn about the deck. Sparks fly from a panel. Cinematic, desperate mood.

*First Impressions:* A cracked viewport frames the void like a black coin. Chairs are still buckled; consoles breathe to life in uneven pulses, shedding static snow. Loose paperwork and straps are tangled around console bases, catching the dim light. A faint comm light blinks, trying to say something through the noise.

**Back**
*Atmosphere:* A center of authority that has been hollowed out. Tension, abandonment, and the indifference of space outside.
*Sensory Details:* The whistle of air cycling (or leaking); the smell of burnt plastic and stale coffee; the visual vertigo of the stars moving past the cracks; the static hiss from the comms.
*Key Features:*
*   **Captain’s Chair:** The central position, often possessing physical keys or overrides.
*   **Navigation Console:** A holographic map table, flickering or corrupted.
*   **Blast Shutters:** Heavy metal shields that can cover the windows (or fail to).
*Hazards:* Vacuum exposure (if window fails); gravity fluctuations; electrical fires; automated security defenses.
*Hidden Aspects:* A hidden intoxicating liquor stash in a panel; a "black box" chip taped under a console; the comms system picking up a signal that shouldn't exist (ghost signal).

# MedBay
Antiseptic, Sterile, Whirring

**Front**
*Image Prompt:* A high-tech futuristic hospital room. Surgical robots with multiple arms hang from the ceiling. Sterile white and blue lighting, but with a creepy, abandoned feel. Medical clutter, maybe a spilled vial or a covered body. Clean but unsettling.

*First Impressions:* A chemical haze hangs like glittering dust in sterile light. Bodies lie sealed under transparent film, faces smoothed by auto-foam. Auto-doc arms twitch to life, then freeze mid-motion. The air smells like antiseptic and hot metal, with a sweetness that shouldn’t be there.

**Back**
*Atmosphere:* Clinical, sterile, and unwittingly hostile. A place of healing that feels like a laboratory.
*Sensory Details:* The cloying sweetness of synthetic anesthetics; the whir of servo-motors tracking movement; blindingly bright lights compared to the rest of the ship.
*Key Features:*
*   **Auto-Doc:** A robotic surgical spider that can heal or harm depending on its calibration.
*   **Fabricator:** A device for printing drugs/bandages, limited by "chem-stock."
*   **Quarantine Fields:** Energy barriers or glass walls designed to isolate infection.
*Hazards:* Miscalibrated surgical bots; toxic chemical spills; instant quarantine lockdowns tracking "contamination."
*Hidden Aspects:* Medical logs that don't match the crew manifest; a stash of highly addictive stimulants; a bio-sample in the freezer that is definitely not human terrain.

# Observation Deck
Vast, Dizzying, Exposed

**Front**
*Image Prompt:* A large observation deck on a spaceship. Floor-to-ceiling windows showing a nebula or star field. Luxury seating that looks torn or displaced. Dust motes floating in light beams. Lonely, vast, existential.

*First Impressions:* Floor-to-ceiling glass looks out onto tumbling wreckage and the lightless sun. For a moment, shadows seem to move on the far side of the glass, as if the ship has an audience. The room groans and clicks as temperature shifts crawl through the hull.

**Back**
*Atmosphere:* Existential dread, vertigo, and the sublime beauty of the void. It feels exposed.
*Sensory Details:* The creaking of the hull (thermal expansion); the visual dizziness of the spinning stars; a temperature drop near the glass; the silence of being far from the engine.
*Key Features:*
*   **The Viewport:** A massive structural weakness that offers clues to location.
*   **Telescopes/Sensors:** Long-range optical instruments for manual sighting.
*   **Lounge Area:** Remnants of comfort—couches, bar—now eerie in their uselessness.
*Hazards:* Structural failure (glass cracking); radiation exposure from a nearby star; vertigo/nausea affecting checks.
*Hidden Aspects:* Weird graffiti etched into the glass with a diamond cutter; a shadow outside that blocks the stars but doesn't show on sensors; a panel that controls exterior hull lights (signaling).

# AI Core Chamber
Freezing, Hushed, Charged

**Front**
*Image Prompt:* The brain of a spaceship. A dark room filled with server racks. In the center, a glowing monolith or column of light representing the AI. Cables cover the floor like tree roots. Cold, digital, blue and black palette.

*First Impressions:* Cable looms gather like roots around a cold, black obelisk of memory lattice. Consoles sit dark, their glass catching thin threads of reflected light. The temperature drops with each step toward the core, and breath crystallizes in the air.

**Back**
*Atmosphere:* Sacred, hushed, and electrically charged. The "temple" of the ship.
*Sensory Details:* The sound of breath crystallizing (extreme cold); the feeling of being watched by the walls; the noise of thousand hard drives spinning up at once; the smell of ozone and super-cooled fluid.
*Key Features:*
*   **The Interface:** A central terminal or voice-input node for conversing with the ship.
*   **Coolant Tanks:** Large reservoirs of liquid nitrogen/helium.
*   **Memory Banks:** Physical slots for inserting or removing AI data shards.
*Hazards:* Halon gas dumps (fire suppression removes O2); Neuro-shock from unshielded interfacing; freezing temperatures.
*Hidden Aspects:* A manual "kill switch" hidden under floor plates; heat signatures in the server racks that suggest a biological presence (hiding/nesting); the code on the screens scrolling characters that form the viewers' names.
