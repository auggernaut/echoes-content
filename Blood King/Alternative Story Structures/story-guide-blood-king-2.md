*A gothic succession crisis one-shot for 3‚Äì5 players using the Castle Deck.*

---

## ü©∏ The Situation

The Blood King has been slain, but his castle remains alive and hungry. The ancient vampire vassals have gathered for a night of succession ‚Äî each claiming the right to inherit the throne and the castle's dark power. The players are not noble vampires, but servants, spies, or opportunists who have infiltrated the castle during this moment of chaos.

They've come seeking **Lady Isabella**, the Blood King's estranged daughter who vanished into the castle's depths after her father's death. Some say she's the true heir, others claim she's plotting to destroy the castle entirely. The castle itself seems to be choosing its new master, its walls pulsing with anticipation as the noble houses prepare for the night's deadly politics.

The castle pulses with alien life, its walls breathing with blood magic. The Blood King's heart still beats somewhere within, and whoever claims it will inherit his power. But the castle is more than just a fortress ‚Äî it's a living entity that feeds on the memories and souls of those who enter.

## üé≠ SCENE 1: The Succession Gates

**The Main Gate** - `[[Biting Gate]]` the castle's wrought iron gates are rusted and twisted, their bars forming faces that seem to watch. Classical music drifts from within, mixed with the sound of distant political debates. The path beyond leads to the main building, flanked by overgrown gardens where roses bloom unnaturally.

**The Gatekeepers** - Two `[[Blood Thrall Guard]]` stand at attention, wearing tattered noble livery. Their eyes are glassy and distant, but they still carry the authority of castle guards. They're under a trance that can be broken with memories of their former lives as loyal servants. When approached, they demand noble invitations or proof of status.

**The Hidden Path** - A `[[Vine Fence]]` encircles the castle grounds, its thorns dripping with a dark substance. A skeleton in noble robes lies near a hole in the fence, clutching a vial of `[[Holy Water]]` and a political journal. The skeleton belongs to a former courtier who tried to infiltrate the castle during the last succession crisis. His journal contains notes about the noble houses' weaknesses, the castle's layout, and a warning about the "heart chamber." The hole in the fence provides an alternative entrance.

**The Noble Gardens** - In the `[[Garden of Roses]]` blood-red flowers sway unnaturally, each pulsing with its own heartbeat. Each rose represents a noble's memory consumed by the castle. Feeding them blood gains favor with the noble houses. The roses seem to whisper fragments of political secrets.

## üé≠ SCENE 2: The Entry Hall

**The Grand Foyer** - `[[Guilded Entry Hall]]` golden surfaces reflect flickering torchlight. A massive stone statue of the Blood King stands guard with eyes that follow movement. The statue's outstretched hand expects an offering. Once a guardian of the castle's treasures, it remembers the Blood King's glory and may help those who show respect for his legacy. Noble robes and house insignias provide disguises and a valuable royal pin.

**The Hall Monitor** - A single `[[Blood Thrall Guard]]` patrols the hall with mechanical movements but a hint of awareness in its eyes. Some are beginning to remember their past lives and might recognize a player's clothing or mannerisms from their former role as servants or courtiers. Alarms summon reinforcements if triggered.

**The Masquerade Prep** - The `[[Hat Room]]` is filled with elaborate masks and headpieces that whisper secrets. Each mask belonged to a previous noble guest and holds a fragment of its wearer's memories. Wearing these items can grant temporary abilities or reveal secrets about the castle's political past.

## üé≠ SCENE 3: The Castle's Secrets

**The Guest Quarters** - `[[Guest Room]]` lavish chamber with hidden compartments. Furniture shifts when no one is looking, and mirrors reflect scenes from the castle's past. Contains magickal items and secrets about previous noble guests.

**The Living Corridors** - `[[Corridors]]` endless halls lined with moving paintings and living statues that turn to watch passersby. Walls breathe with old blood and magic. Each painting shows a scene from the castle's past ‚Äî some depict the Blood King's reign, others show Lady Isabella's childhood. Players can learn crucial information by studying these scenes.

**The Spectral Advisor** - `[[Mirrored Soul]]` spectral figure made of liquid silver with constantly shifting form. Speaks in riddles and was once the Blood King's chief advisor who tried to prevent the succession crisis. Knows the castle's secrets but demands memories as payment ‚Äî the more precious the memory, the more valuable the information.

**The Political Kitchen** - `[[Kitchen]]` contains the Blood Extractor and caged political prisoners. Kitchen staff work tirelessly preparing "meals" for the noble guests. Former servants transformed by castle magic, some remember their humanity and may help players who show kindness.

**The Political Prisoners** - `[[Blood Prisoner]]` (1-2 cards) some are former advisors, others are nobles who opposed the Blood King. One prisoner might be a former courtier who knows the location of the heart chamber. Another could be a mage who understands how to disrupt the succession ritual.

## üé≠ SCENE 4: The Great Hall Gathering

**The Succession Assembly** - `[[Great Hall]]` alive with the noble gathering. Vampires in elaborate masks debate and scheme with graceful, predatory movements. The Golden Throne stands empty at the far end, pulsing with dark energy. Contains a hidden compartment with a golden crown of immense value. The throne is a focal point for the castle's power.

**The Living Doors** - `[[Monstrous Doors]]` line the hall with carvings that move and whisper. They react to the unnatural, opening and closing of their own accord. Some lead to secret passages or hidden chambers.

**The Noble Feast** - `[[Dining Room]]` blood servants serve ghastly meals while muffled screams echo from the kitchen. Food moves on its own, wine is suspiciously thick. Features fresh "meals" and the sounds of suffering.

**The Noble Servants** - `[[Blood Servants]]` (2-3 cards) former courtiers and servants transformed by the castle's magic. They serve the castle's will but some retain fragments of their former selves. They can be influenced by displays of nobility or kindness and ignore PCs unless attacked.

**The Queen Mother** - `[[Banshee Noble]]` (as the Blood King's widow) spectral noblewoman in mourning dress who moves through the crowd like a ghost. The Blood King's widow who died during his reign. Her spirit was bound to the castle by her husband's grief. She seeks to protect his legacy but doesn't recognize the current situation. Can be soothed by memories of her past life.

---

## üé≠ SCENE 5: The Midnight Ritual

**The Queen Remembers** - `[[Banshee Noble]]` (as the Blood King's widow) reveals her true nature as the Blood King's widow. Her spectral form becomes more solid as the ritual approaches. She sings lullabies she doesn't remember teaching her daughter. As the ritual approaches, she begins to remember fragments of her past. If players can help her remember her humanity, she may turn against the scheming nobles.

**The Hunters** - `[[Shadow Hound]]` (2-3 cards) emerge from darkness with forms shifting between shadow and substance. Manifestations of the castle's hunger for souls. They hunt those who don't belong but can be fooled by successful masquerading as nobles. They're drawn to fear and can sense those who are hiding.

**The Ritual Begins** - `[[Great Hall]]` transforms as the ritual begins. Air becomes thick with blood magic, castle pulses with anticipation. The Golden Throne glows with dark energy. The castle's magic peaks at midnight, making this the only time the succession can be performed ‚Äî or disrupted.

**The Pretender** - `[[Blood King]]` (if he appears) figure of terrible beauty with eyes reflecting the dark magic within. Once a noble lord, corrupted by ambition during the succession crisis. He still remembers his humanity and fights the corruption's influence. His claim to the throne, which he removed and hid, is the source of his power and his weakness.

## üé≠ SCENE 6: The Heart of the Matter

**The Soul's Price** - `[[Mirrored Soul]]` reveals the location of the Blood King's heart ‚Äî it beats within a hidden chamber accessible only through the mirrors. Knows the exact location and demands the most precious memories as payment for this crucial information.

**The Tools** - `[[Kitchen]]` (if not used before) may hold tools needed to reach the heart chamber. Kitchen staff work tirelessly and some remember their humanity, potentially helping players who show kindness.

**The Knowledge** - `[[Blood Prisoner]]` (if not used before) one prisoner is a former court mage who knows how to reach the heart chamber. Another is a noble who witnessed the heart's concealment. A third might be a former advisor who has been trying to reach the heart for months.

**The Confrontation** - `[[Blood King]]` (if not appeared yet) must face the pretender in his full power, or attempt to destroy the heart while avoiding his wrath. The heart is the source of his power and destroying it will stop him but may destroy the castle.

---

## üé≠ SCENE 7: The Final Choice

**The Heir's Return** - `[[Seleana]]` (if she appears) Lady Isabella, the Blood King's estranged daughter who entered the castle after her father's death. She may have been changed by her time in the castle ‚Äî perhaps becoming a vampire herself, or finding a way to turn the castle's magic against itself. Her goals may have shifted, and she may not want to be "rescued."

**The Pretender's Ascension** - `[[Blood King]]` (if still alive) makes his final move toward claiming the throne. He may offer players power in exchange for their help, or try to consume them to fuel the ritual. His humanity still fights the corruption, creating moments of vulnerability.

**The Final Stage** - `[[Great Hall]]` becomes the stage for the final confrontation, walls pulsing with the castle's life force. The castle's magic is tied to the Blood King's heart. Destroying the heart will stop the pretender but may also destroy the castle and free all the bound spirits within.

**The Queen's Choice** - `[[Banshee Noble]]` (as the Blood King's widow, if still present) must choose between her husband's legacy and her humanity. If players have helped her remember her past, she may turn against the pretender. If not, she will protect the throne to the end, even if it means her own destruction.
