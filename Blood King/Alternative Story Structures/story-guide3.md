## The Hook: Why You're Here

The letter arrived three days ago, written in your grandmother's shaky hand: "Come to Rosewood Manor immediately. Your father's will is being read. Bring proof of your identity."

You haven't seen your family in ten years. Not since the night your father disappeared from this very manor, leaving behind only a trail of blood and unanswered questions. The police called it a suicide, but you know better. Your father would never have left you like that.

Now you and your estranged siblings have been summoned back to the manor that holds your family's darkest secrets. The inheritance is substantial—millions in property, antiques, and hidden accounts. But someone in this family is willing to kill for it.

> **What did your father tell you before he disappeared?**  
> **Which sibling do you trust the least, and why?**

### Scene 2: The Great Hall Reading

**What the Players Experience:**  
The family gathers in the grand hall where the will is to be read. The golden throne sits empty, but everyone treats it as if your father still sits there. The lawyer arrives with the documents.

**What the GM Reveals Here:**  
> The will is unusual—it requires all heirs to spend one night in the manor before the inheritance is distributed.  
> Your father's body was never found, only his blood.  
> The lawyer seems nervous, as if he knows something he's not telling.

**Reveal Through:**  
The lawyer's trembling hands as he reads. The way family members avoid looking at the throne. A stain on the floor that looks suspiciously like old blood.

### Scene 3: The Banshee's Warning

**What the Players Experience:**  
A spectral woman in period dress appears, her jewelry catching the candlelight. She sings a lullaby that makes everyone uneasy—it's the same song your mother used to sing.

**What the GM Reveals Here:**  
> The banshee is your mother's ghost, trapped in the manor since her death.  
> She's trying to warn you about what really happened to your father.  
> Her ring bears the family crest—the same one on the manor's deed.

> The vines are poisonous, and someone has been using them.  
> The skeleton near the hole is wearing your father's watch.

## 🧰 GM Tips

- **📦 Focus on family dynamics.** Use real-world motivations like greed, jealousy, and revenge.
- **🔁 Let the cards represent physical locations.** Each area holds clues about the family's past.
- **🩸 Keep the horror grounded.** The scares come from human nature, not supernatural forces.
- **🎭 Build tension through suspicion.** Everyone has secrets, everyone could be the killer.

> Remember: this is a story about family, money, and the lengths people will go to protect their secrets. The manor is just the stage where the drama plays out.
