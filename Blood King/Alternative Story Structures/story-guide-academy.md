# STORY GUIDE: The Cursed Academy (Scene-Based)

*A gothic mystery one-shot for 3‚Äì5 players using the Castle Deck.*

---

## üè´ The Situation

The prestigious Blackwood Academy has been closed for months after a series of mysterious disappearances. Students were vanishing, only to return changed ‚Äî hollow-eyed, pale, and speaking of strange dreams. The headmaster, Professor Blackwood, claims the academy is "under renovation," but locals whisper of dark rituals and forbidden experiments.

The players are investigators, former students, or concerned family members who have come to uncover the truth. They've heard rumors that the academy's ancient library contains a book that can reverse the transformations, but the building itself seems to resist investigation, its halls shifting and its inhabitants becoming more monstrous by the day.

The academy pulses with unnatural energy, its stone walls breathing with dark magic. Professor Blackwood's research into immortality has corrupted the very foundation of the school, and without finding his hidden laboratory, the curse cannot be broken.

## üé≠ SCENE 1: The Academy Gates

**The Main Entrance** - `[[Biting Gate]]` the academy's wrought iron gates are rusted and twisted, their bars forming faces that seem to watch. Classical music drifts from within, mixed with the sound of distant chanting. The path beyond leads to the main building, flanked by overgrown gardens where roses bloom unnaturally.

**The Gatekeepers** - Two `[[Blood Thrall Guard]]` stand at attention, wearing tattered academic robes instead of armor. Their eyes are glassy and distant, but they still carry the authority of school monitors. They're under a trance that can be broken with memories of their former lives as students or teachers. When approached, they demand student IDs or visitor passes.

**The Hidden Path** - A `[[Vine Fence]]` encircles the academy grounds, its thorns dripping with a dark substance. A skeleton in a lab coat lies near a gap in the fence, clutching a vial of `[[Holy Water]]` and a research journal. The skeleton belongs to a former professor who tried to investigate the academy months ago. His journal contains notes about Professor Blackwood's weaknesses, the academy's layout, and a warning about the "transformation chamber." The gap in the fence provides an alternative entrance.

**The Cursed Gardens** - In the `[[Garden of Roses]]` blood-red flowers sway unnaturally, each pulsing with its own heartbeat. Each rose represents a student's memory consumed by the academy. Feeding them blood gains favor with the transformed students. The roses seem to whisper fragments of lost knowledge.

## üé≠ SCENE 2: The Entry Hall

**The Grand Foyer** - `[[Guilded Entry Hall]]` golden surfaces reflect flickering torchlight. A massive stone statue of the academy's founder stands guard with eyes that follow movement. The statue's outstretched hand expects an offering. Once a guardian of the academy's knowledge, it remembers the school's former glory and may help those who show respect for its history. Academic robes and student IDs provide disguises and a valuable scholar's pin.

**The Hall Monitor** - A single `[[Blood Thrall Guard]]` patrols the hall with mechanical movements but a hint of awareness in its eyes. Some are beginning to remember their past lives and might recognize a player's clothing or mannerisms from their former role as students or staff. Alarms summon reinforcements if triggered.

**The Costume Room** - The `[[Hat Room]]` is filled with academic caps, graduation robes, and ceremonial masks that whisper secrets. Each item belonged to a previous student or teacher and holds a fragment of its wearer's memories. Wearing these items can grant temporary abilities or reveal secrets about the academy's past.

## üé≠ SCENE 3: The Academy's Secrets

**The Living Hallways** - `[[Corridors]]` endless halls lined with moving paintings and living statues that turn to watch passersby. Walls breathe with old magic and the scent of chalk dust.

Players can learn crucial information by studying these scenes.

**The Spectral Librarian** - `[[Mirrored Soul]]` spectral figure made of liquid silver with constantly shifting form.

**The Assembly Hall** - `[[Great Hall]]` alive with the academy's daily assembly. Transformed students in academic robes gather and scheme with graceful, predatory movements.

**The Living Doors** - `[[Monstrous Doors]]` line the hall with carvings that move and whisper. They react to the unnatural, opening and closing of their own accord. Some lead to secret passages or hidden chambers.

**The Dining Hall** - `[[Dining Room]]` transformed students serve ghastly meals while muffled screams echo from the kitchen. Food moves on its own, the punch is suspiciously thick. Features fresh "meals" and the sounds of suffering.

They serve the academy's will but some retain fragments of their former selves. They can be influenced by displays of academic knowledge or kindness and ignore PCs unless attacked.

**The Headmaster's Wife** - `[[Banshee Noble]]` (as Professor Blackwood's wife) spectral noblewoman in mourning dress who moves through the crowd like a ghost.

## üé≠ SCENE 5: The Midnight Ritual

**The Wife Remembers** - `[[Banshee Noble]]` (as the Headmaster's wife) reveals her true nature as Professor Blackwood's wife. Her spectral form becomes more solid as the ritual approaches. She sings lullabies she doesn't remember teaching her students. As the ritual approaches, she begins to remember fragments of her past. If players can help her remember her humanity, she may turn against Professor Blackwood.

**The Hunters** - `[[Shadow Hound]]` (2-3 cards) emerge from darkness with forms shifting between shadow and substance. Manifestations of the academy's hunger for knowledge and souls. They hunt those who don't belong but can be fooled by successful masquerading as students. They're drawn to fear and can sense those who are hiding.

**The Ritual Begins** - `[[Great Hall]]` transforms as the ritual begins. Air becomes thick with dark magic, academy pulses with anticipation. The Headmaster's Chair glows with dark energy. The academy's magic peaks at midnight, making this the only time the ritual can be performed ‚Äî or disrupted.

**The Headmaster** - `[[Blood King]]` (if he appears) figure of terrible beauty with eyes reflecting the dark magic within. Once Professor Blackwood, corrupted by forbidden knowledge during experiments to extend life. He still remembers his humanity and fights the corruption's influence.

## üé≠ SCENE 7: The Final Choice

**The Investigator's Return** - `[[Seleana]]` (if she appears) a legendary investigator who entered the academy two years ago. She may have been changed by her time in the academy ‚Äî perhaps becoming a transformed student herself, or finding a way to turn the academy's magic against itself. Her goals may have shifted, and she may not want to be "rescued."

**The Headmaster's Ascension** - `[[Blood King]]` (if still alive) makes his final move toward transformation. He may offer players knowledge in exchange for their help, or try to consume them to fuel the ritual. His humanity still fights the corruption, creating moments of vulnerability.

**The Final Stage** - `[[Great Hall]]` becomes the stage for the final confrontation, walls pulsing with the academy's life force. The academy's magic is tied to Professor Blackwood's research. Destroying the research will stop him but may also destroy the academy and free all the bound spirits within.

**The Wife's Choice** - `[[Banshee Noble]]` (as the Headmaster's wife, if still present) must choose between her husband and her humanity. If players have helped her remember her past, she may turn against Professor Blackwood. If not, she will protect him to the end, even if it means her own destruction.
