## ü©∏ The Situation

The Blood King ‚Äî a once-human monarch possessed by an alien parasite ‚Äî has summoned his ancient vampire vassals for a masked gathering under a bleeding moon. Tonight, he will ascend beyond undeath. The players are not invited guests. They've come seeking **Seleana Suantis**, a vampire hunter who vanished into the castle two years ago. Some say she still lives within, hunting the King from the shadows.

The castle pulses with alien life, its walls breathing with blood magic. The Blood King's heart beats somewhere within, and without it, he cannot be slain. But the castle is more than just a fortress ‚Äî it's a living entity that feeds on the memories and souls of those who enter.
