# STORY GUIDE: The Living Prison (Short Version)

---

## 🎬 Intro Hook

Blood Manor is a living, breathing fortress of flesh and stone, pulsing with alien blood magic. Once ruled by the dreaded Blood King, the manor itself has turned on its master—imprisoning him deep within its heart. Now, the castle lures outsiders with dreams, bargains, or threats, using them as pawns in its own inscrutable designs. The halls are alive with shifting walls, hungry veins, and the whispers of those who have been absorbed into the manor’s flesh.

## 🎭 Possible Motivations for PCs (with Whys)

- **Free the Blood King:** You are bound by a pact, curse, or promise; only by freeing the King can you save yourself or someone you love.
- **Destroy the Blood King:** The King’s influence ruined your life, and you believe ending him will break the manor’s curse.
- **Bargain with the Manor:** The living castle has promised you power, knowledge, or a lost memory—if you do its bidding.
- **Rescue a Prisoner:** Someone dear to you is trapped within the manor’s walls, and only by navigating its living corridors can you reach them.
- **Escape the Manor:** You were lured or captured, and now survival means outwitting both the King and the sentient castle.
