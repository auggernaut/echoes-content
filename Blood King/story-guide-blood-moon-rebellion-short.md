# STORY GUIDE: Blood Moon Rebellion (Short Version)

---

## 🎬 Intro Hook

Blood Manor, a sentient castle perched on a storm-lashed cliff, has been thrown into chaos. The Blood King’s rule is faltering as a rebellion brews within the manor’s walls. Tonight, under a blood-red moon, the King’s most dangerous enemies—disguised as guests—plot to overthrow him. The halls are filled with loyalists, traitors, and desperate souls seeking freedom or vengeance.

## 🎭 Possible Motivations for PCs (with Whys)
- **Lead the rebellion:** The King’s cruelty destroyed your family, and you’ve infiltrated the manor to end his reign.
- **Protect the King:** You are bound by loyalty, blood, or a dark pact, and must root out the traitors before it’s too late.
- **Rescue a loved one:** Someone dear to you is held hostage in the manor, and only the chaos of rebellion gives you a chance to save them.
- **Steal the King’s secrets:** You seek forbidden knowledge or a powerful artifact hidden in the manor, hoping to use the rebellion as cover.
- **Escape the manor:** You were captured or lured here, and now survival means playing both sides until you can slip away.
