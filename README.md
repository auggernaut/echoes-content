# Story Guide Structure Comparison

## üé≠ Scene-by-Scene vs High-Level Approaches

This document explains the differences between structured scene-based story guides and high-level descriptive guides, helping you choose the right approach for your game.

---

## üéØ Scene-by-Scene Approach

### What It Is
A story guide that breaks down the adventure into specific scenes, each with:
- **Exact card draws** (primary/secondary designations)
- **Detailed story setup** and descriptions
- **GM guidance** with mechanics and lore
- **Player options** to guide action
- **Clear progression** from scene to scene

### Advantages

**For New/Stressed GMs:**
- **Clear roadmap** - You know exactly what to do next
- **Specific card draws** - No decision paralysis about which cards to use
- **Guided descriptions** - You have concrete details to work with
- **Predictable pacing** - Each scene has a clear purpose and duration

**For One-Shots:**
- **Time management** - You can estimate how long each scene will take
- **No missing beats** - Important story elements are guaranteed to appear
- **Player guidance** - Clear options help players understand what they can do
- **Consistent experience** - Every group gets the key moments

### Best For
- One-shots and convention games
- New GMs or GMs new to the system
- Time-constrained sessions
- Groups that need more structure
- First-time players

## üìö High-Level Approach

### What It Is
A story guide that provides:
- **Broad phase descriptions** with general card suggestions
- **Detailed NPC backgrounds** and motivations
- **Lore and secrets** for reference
- **GM moves** for improvisation
- **Flexible structure** that adapts to player choices

### Advantages

**For Experienced GMs:**
- **Maximum flexibility** - Adapt to any player direction
- **Creative freedom** - Improvise based on the moment
- **Reusable content** - NPCs and lore work in multiple scenarios
- **Player agency** - No forced story beats

**For Campaigns:**
- **Long-term planning** - NPCs can recur across sessions
- **World building** - Rich lore supports ongoing play
- **Character development** - NPCs can grow and change
- **Sandbox play** - Players drive the story direction

### Challenges

**Decision Fatigue:**
- GMs have to constantly decide which cards to draw
- Timing becomes unpredictable
- Risk of missing important story beats
- Players might get stuck without clear direction

**Memory Burden:**
- GMs must remember all the NPC details and lore
- Hard to reference during play
- Easy to forget important connections
- More prep time required

### Best For
- Experienced GMs who prefer improvisation
- Long-running campaigns
- Groups that enjoy sandbox play
- When you want maximum flexibility
- GMs who know the system well

## üí° Hybrid Approach

The ideal might be a **scene-based structure with high-level context**:
- Use scenes for the main story beats
- Include the NPC/lore details as reference material
- Allow GMs to skip or modify scenes based on player choices
- Provide "GM moves" for when players go off-script

### Example Structure
```
## Scene 1: The Arrival
[Specific card draws and guided storytelling]

## NPC Reference
[Detailed backgrounds for when NPCs appear]

## GM Moves
[Improvisation tools for unexpected situations]
```

### Use Scene-by-Scene When:
- Running a one-shot

- You're new to the system
- Players need structure

### Use High-Level When:
- Running a campaign
- You're experienced with the system
- Players prefer sandbox play
- You want maximum flexibility
- You have time to improvise
- You're comfortable with card management

### Use Hybrid When:
- You want the best of both worlds
- Running a multi-session adventure
- You have mixed experience levels
- You want structure with flexibility

## üÉè Card Management Considerations

### Scene-by-Scene
- **Predictable** - You know exactly which cards you'll need
- **Efficient** - No wasted cards or unused content
- **Controlled** - Each card serves a specific story purpose
- **Prep-friendly** - Easy to organize and shuffle

### High-Level
- **Flexible** - Cards can be used in multiple ways
- **Reactive** - Draw cards based on player choices
- **Creative** - Cards inspire unexpected story directions

## üìù Documentation Tips

### For Scene-Based Guides:
- Number your scenes clearly
- Specify card quantities and types
- Include timing estimates
- Provide clear transition points
- Add "if players do X, then Y" contingencies

### For High-Level Guides:
- Organize NPCs by importance
- Create quick-reference tables
- Include multiple story paths
- Provide improvisation prompts
- Add "GM moves" for common situations

## üéØ Conclusion

**For Castle Deck games specifically**, I recommend the scene-based approach because:
1. **Card management** is easier with specific draws
2. **Gothic horror** benefits from controlled pacing
3. **One-shot format** needs reliable structure
4. **New players** appreciate clear guidance

The scene structure gives GMs confidence while still allowing for creativity within each scene. It's like having training wheels that you can take off once you're comfortable with the system.

**Remember:** The best approach is the one that makes you feel confident and excited to run the game. Choose what works for your style and your group's needs.
