*A gothic survival horror one-shot for 3‚Äì5 players using the Castle Deck.*

---

## ü©∏ The Situation

The players wake up in the depths of the Blood King's castle, bound and gagged, with the taste of blood in their mouths. They've been captured and prepared as the main course for tonight's grand feast ‚Äî a celebration of the Blood King's ascension. The castle's vampire nobility has gathered to witness the ritual and partake in the "special meal."

The players must escape their bonds, navigate the castle's horrors, and either flee for their lives or find a way to turn the tables on their captors. The castle pulses with alien life, its walls breathing with blood magic, and every shadow could hide a hungry vampire or a bloodthirsty servant.

The Blood King's heart beats somewhere within, and without it, he cannot be slain. But the castle is more than just a fortress ‚Äî it's a living entity that feeds on the memories and souls of those who enter.

## üé≠ SCENE 1: The Prisoner's Awakening

**The Cell** - `[[Kitchen]]` you wake up in a bloodied cell within the castle's depths. The air is thick with the scent of fear and old blood. Rusty chains hang from the walls, and a stained metal table (the Blood Extractor) dominates the center of the room. Other prisoners huddle in cages, some already transformed by the castle's magic. The kitchen staff work tirelessly, preparing "meals" for the feast above.

**The Guards** - Two `[[Blood Thrall Guard]]` stand watch over the prisoners, wearing tattered servant uniforms. Their eyes are glassy and distant, but they still carry the authority of jailers. They're under a trance that can be broken with memories of their former lives as free people. When prisoners try to escape, they respond with brutal efficiency.

**The Hidden Passage** - A `[[Vine Fence]]` blocks a potential escape route, its thorns dripping with a dark substance. A skeleton in prisoner's rags lies near a gap in the fence, clutching a vial of `[[Holy Water]]` and a desperate note. The skeleton belongs to a former prisoner who tried to escape months ago. His note contains warnings about the castle's layout, the feast schedule, and a desperate plea for help. The gap in the fence might provide an escape route.

**The Prisoners** - `[[Blood Prisoner]]` (2-3 cards) your fellow captives react in various ways to the situation. Some are paralyzed with fear, others plead for help, a few might be planning their own escape. One prisoner might know secret passages, another could have information about the feast above.

## üé≠ SCENE 2: The Escape Route

**The Service Tunnels** - `[[Corridors]]` endless stone passages lined with moving shadows and living darkness. The walls themselves seem to breathe, and the air is thick with the scent of old blood and magic. Each shadow shows a scene from the castle's past ‚Äî some depict previous feasts, others show the Blood King's transformation. Players can learn crucial information by studying these scenes.

**The Spectral Guide** - `[[Mirrored Soul]]` spectral figure made of liquid silver with constantly shifting form. Speaks in riddles and was once a prisoner who escaped but was caught again. Knows the castle's secrets but demands memories as payment ‚Äî the more precious the memory, the more valuable the information. May help players escape for a price.

**The Masquerade Prep** - The `[[Hat Room]]` is filled with elaborate masks and headpieces that whisper secrets. Each mask belonged to a previous "guest" and holds a fragment of its wearer's memories. Wearing a mask can grant temporary abilities or reveal secrets about the castle's past. Some masks might help players blend in with the feast above.

## üé≠ SCENE 3: The Feast Preparations

**The Grand Hall** - `[[Great Hall]]` the castle's main hall is being prepared for the grand feast. Vampires in elaborate masks and servants in bloodstained uniforms arrange tables and decorations. The Golden Throne stands at the far end, pulsing with dark energy. Contains a hidden compartment with a golden coffin of immense value. The throne is a focal point for the castle's power.

**The Living Doors** - `[[Monstrous Doors]]` line the hall with carvings that move and whisper. They react to the unnatural, opening and closing of their own accord. Some lead to secret passages or hidden chambers that might provide escape routes.

**The Feast Setup** - `[[Dining Room]]` blood servants arrange the dining tables while muffled screams echo from the kitchen below. Food moves on its own, wine is suspiciously thick. Features fresh "meals" and the sounds of suffering. The tables are being set for the grand feast where the players are meant to be the main course.

**The Servants** - `[[Blood Servants]]` (2-3 cards) former humans transformed by the castle's magic. They serve the castle's will but some retain fragments of their former selves. They can be influenced by displays of desperation or kindness and ignore escaped prisoners unless attacked.

**The Mother's Ghost** - `[[Banshee Noble]]` (as Lenice) spectral noblewoman in mourning dress who moves through the preparations like a ghost. The Blood King's mortal mother who died during his transformation. Her spirit was bound to the castle by her son's grief. She seeks to protect him but doesn't recognize him anymore. Can be soothed by memories of her past life.

## üé≠ SCENE 4: The Feast Begins

**The Masquerade** - `[[Great Hall]]` alive with the grand feast. Vampires in elaborate masks take their seats with graceful, predatory movements. The Golden Throne stands occupied by the Blood King, pulsing with dark energy. The feast is about to begin, and the players are the main course.

**The Hunters** - `[[Shadow Hound]]` (2-3 cards) emerge from darkness with forms shifting between shadow and substance. Manifestations of the castle's hunger for souls. They hunt escaped prisoners but can be fooled by successful masquerading as servants. They're drawn to fear and can sense those who are hiding.

**The Blood King** - `[[Blood King]]` (if he appears) figure of terrible beauty with eyes reflecting the alien parasite within. Once King Aldric, possessed by an alien parasite during a failed ritual to extend his life. He still remembers his humanity and fights the parasite's influence. His heart, which he removed and hid, is the source of his power and his weakness.

**The Feast** - `[[Dining Room]]` the grand feast begins. Blood servants serve the ghastly meal while muffled screams echo from the kitchen. Food moves on its own, wine is suspiciously thick. The vampires are about to discover that their "meal" has escaped.

## üé≠ SCENE 5: The Escape or Confrontation

**The Soul's Price** - `[[Mirrored Soul]]` reveals the location of the Blood King's heart ‚Äî it beats within a hidden chamber accessible only through the mirrors. Knows the exact location and demands the most precious memories as payment for this crucial information. May help players escape or turn the tables.

**The Tools** - `[[Kitchen]]` (if not used before) may hold tools needed to escape or fight back. Kitchen staff work tirelessly and some remember their humanity, potentially helping players who show kindness.

**The Knowledge** - `[[Blood Prisoner]]` (if not used before) one prisoner is a former court mage who knows how to reach the heart chamber. Another is a noble who witnessed the heart's concealment. A third might be a former hunter who has been trying to reach the heart for months.

**The Confrontation** - `[[Blood King]]` (if not appeared yet) must face the Blood King in his full power, or attempt to destroy the heart while avoiding his wrath. The heart is the source of his power and destroying it will kill him but may destroy the castle.

## üé≠ SCENE 6: The Final Choice

**The Hunter's Return** - `[[Seleana]]` (if she appears) a legendary vampire hunter who entered the castle two years ago. She may have been changed by her time in the castle ‚Äî perhaps becoming a vampire herself, or finding a way to turn the castle's magic against itself. Her goals may have shifted, and she may not want to be "rescued."

**The King's Feast** - `[[Blood King]]` (if still alive) makes his final move toward consuming the players. He may offer players power in exchange for their help, or try to consume them to fuel the ritual. His humanity still fights the parasite, creating moments of vulnerability.

**The Final Stage** - `[[Great Hall]]` becomes the stage for the final confrontation, walls pulsing with the castle's life force. The castle's magic is tied to the Blood King's heart. Destroying the heart will kill the King but may also destroy the castle and free all the bound spirits within.

**The Mother's Choice** - `[[Banshee Noble]]` (as Lenice, if still present) must choose between her son and her humanity. If players have helped her remember her past, she may turn against the Blood King. If not, she will protect him to the end, even if it means her own destruction.
